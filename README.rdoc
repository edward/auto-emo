= auto-emo

Sometimes, you just need a whole lot of generated emo poetry.

Poems were filched from across the web. No more than a single line from each appears in any generated stanza.

== Usage

$ auto-emo [-n poems]
    -n, --number N                   Generate N poems (default is 3)

== Copyright

The pilfered poems are definitely not copyrighted by me, but everything else is.
