can begin the process of getting over you"5can anybody help me find what i'm searching for?"9because every time i find it, someone locks the door"6i've been searching everywhere, even far and wide"9but all it seems to want to do is disappear and hide"3could it be inside my room, underneath my bed?"4or maybe it's just really tucked inside my head"7tucked away, far down deep, where no one ever goes":perhaps its all my thoughts, like how the river flows"5maybe they're just memories, fading far and fast"9and i'm scared. wondering how many of them will last":or maybe they're just
