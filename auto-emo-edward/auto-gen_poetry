I'm not a normal girl any more
A wonderful start, too?)
but I've given you plenty of chances
Art is my escape
all your biggest fears subside
ripping me apart
Sleep intertwined in the stars

these feeling's buried beneath our skin
Suicide notes in cursive scrawls
But these are only thoughts
I know it.
more to ponder,
Almost all the time
I helped you through
You pierced me swiftly,

People don’t notice or remember me
i got to go
Scissors cut like knifes on skin,
to haunt my dreams
Small soft eyelids shut,
Apparently nothing can go right.
† † †You made me want to kill you.
† † † † † I plunge my hand into the murky water. . .
with serine silance.

from the streets of Delray.
It's my fault the sky wasn't as bright.....
was what I could give
Sent from the aboves
Beneath this immortal disease,
that is never remembered
to be better, and not so useless.
Yet, truly, she does not care.

now that i have wings
I'm sorry for the tears on your pillow
Sunday night with the
I love to watch the blood.
I must be a failure

Living and Dying
And you don't know
Even if you don't love me
You’ll never fade.
When You said you were going to college
I trust him with my whole being,

I'm going to glue some Maryjane to the wall
Dressed in white. This candle radiates throughout the night
I cannot hide.
as Daddy's suede boots
that haunt my dreams
Dead flesh
You said you loved me

my dear angel
I just do
"And they all thought I was dumb!"
Not ever once caring enough
The One Person who called you family
For in my kiss
But he wasnt pure enough, never reached her standurds,
Then with
blood washing away like water,
Or else i will die.

And no matter what we say
still I try to hide, the hurt I feel inside.
and for once
school is a nightmare
Wake up

I die
since last he heard this uttering
To hide her from sun,
Those imbecils . . .
i think im tripping out
So I want to change a bit.
Only girls who can be lost
I need you

In a soft, euphoric flash
Dripping, Oozing, melting
You're with other girls
ill pray for your ill never wanna make you sader.
I would not have met Micheal
Never Again, I dont wanna hear
Trough the eye of a microscope,
† † † † † † † † † † † † † † † † †you’re dead
a response never wrong
My heart races while I'm with him

the only thing he had with him
In the Blue Wastebasket
Of his eyes.
And I only wonder if you feel the same.
you grab my arm
are what they seem
to hear the screams of distruction and replace them

of all creatures
The words that I write dont help my feelings (nothing can help me now)
For you, I've waited
i hate them. i hate my family.
Because your not with me today
settling upon the planetary floor.
It held me through my pain

My poems really stink...
my lust was overwhelming
That you shove to the corners
I think to myself,did the catch him?
Tease me or please me
We will always get threw
But the mirror is playing what she wants to be.
I was your radio
It's no ones fault but my own,

(don't be so cruel)
It's hard to love someone without
† † † † † † † † † † † † † † Shes going to college now.
The picture on the wall
Blood Stains On An Ashen Face

in this tease
of despair
quickly smoke some dope
And now i do mo'
All they can do is wait

And this smile is so soon wearing thin.
But im never able to forget
acclimating to the motor
you hurt me
I liked it best here
for the pain you've caused.

And all i fear
and the dreams forgotten.
Why am I alone?
Her lifeless body was floating on top,
Is that even real?
Licorice, Chocolate, Skittles
While the sun gets the early bird special
Hoping she will respond
you do your thing and I do mine
End of Author Entry

A definition of this word
But apparently according to people
Bring me back to Cleveland, I miss the beach
your diamond eyes, they shine
But it's not just one
So I won't run away again.
And why
i didn't want to go to that place
but like the fool I am

The alarm didn't go off,
I guess your life is more important
Being Placed In The Ground,
head and heart filled with pain
that mummy is not there
Reminds me that everyone can go from a bitter summer storm
That seep skin deep
Show me.
Now excuse me for a moment I'm beginning to sob

the sun is down
I've tried to tell you how I feel,
Every time I start fallin hard for a guy
And...; Just...
From love and its pain

Someone who would listen to my cries
my stomach starts to bend......
we walk
I felt my life complete
red...full of sadness...drained...weeping black waterfalls...
To put you behind
Oh I will...
As the night she passed out in the rain.
Like rain from the sky,

Realize
Of all people why him?
I'm a piece to a puzzle
I'm at your expense
my body on the ground
If looking upon the nothings
Llama,
From all we could have had

Time passed by so slowly, it seemed years went by.
these horomones
To cease the beating!!
With a horrible story of loss to tell.
It seemed out of reach, so high above
Just leave.
I love you more than you will know
To feel alive
† † † † † † † † † † † † When his fiancee wasn't.

On the wooden floor I cry.
In our empty storage shed.
into his seductive hands
And another to your parents
Now sane; forever doomed.
I held you,

The great Ashen Lord watching the faithless depart,
My legs happily support me
So lost..
Or ever have been before...
To light the way inspite of the damage my journey endured
I wish i could turn my mind off
there we cry together

You didn't teach me to live without you
and life is unknown.
Its all secrets under the covers.
And tried the day before my Birthday
Crosses your X's
A smile fades
you!

Under a rainbow so bright!
Waiting here for you
I can't do this, no, not now.
The sun burned my eyes
I'll find someone better who deserves all I offer
Wishing to answer
It fills me with joy,

months of tears
will take me over the edge
everythings alright.
You took me for granted

You're all I miss,
As I imagine the deep cutting.
The girl that I see, is lost and alone,
For you...
Raining razors of hate

[Person 1]
Your mouth!
You are just one of the few
All I need is for you to love me
You wont tell me how you feel
Could you tell me
For this depressing problem
Break me into my heartache
And if it is within my control
In conquest and in her thoughts.

† † † † † † † † † † †I hid behind blushed cheeks.
In the game of life
From your obsession,
Listen to them.

i couldnt breath i didnt want to accept it
I can't breath
i dont need these words
I’m waiting to be healed
And for that second I am home
love isn't love without

I dismount my corpse, fully pleased.
What we said and did
Watch her elegant flair
Look at my heart shattered and know the pain will continue
Didn't talk....
than anything before
a blurry vison and a cold stare

It wasn't meant to be,
Though autumn colors fall and fade
Not My family,
Why I stay up thinking about you till I cry
before i became obsessed with black,
The stories it tells
forget, this last fight,
find are
That everything is all right

You have forgotten
at the same time
Because their life is just that damn hard
What I Painted Were...
I'm dieing without you in my life
Speak in lie.

Heart was tossed
past all the bull-shit hype.
The thread that held you together
to the stars with you in my arms
Faceless like others
These tears they fall,

But this is too much!
In the end you said you didn’t love me
I'm broken inside
I dont want to do it again
Why
I looked directly into your eyes,
>>>
Forget nothing,
Sorrow and hearts

I know you cant make the rent
Every year on this special day
back together. I dont mind their cuts on my fingers.
past all the bull-shit hype.
Competing with her is like trying to find my shadow on a cloudy day
But it's not it's worse
No more me and you
And I'll hold my memories close to my heart,
Because its the only way I can hear your voice anymore.

† † † † †I'll tame it with my heart,
you won't come back to me
Tease me or please me
But not for any suicidal intention.
Its not like you can die and then come back alive again,
Sleeping to escape the pain

I wonder what I've done....
in the end, your inner strength to fight this had prevailed
telling me to be stronger than you
You wont bring me down today
The answers to all the greatest questions.
The rest of our lives
Where your from
There's more to me than meets the eye

And that 'Sorry' was all you wanted even though it should be mine
death
And I can only hope that I'll never need to find out.
It really confuses me when
. . . Just for a minutue,

Cursed to find nothing
How can we ìjust be friends,î
betrayal by the one i loved and trusted has
I wasn't selfish
To feel alive
ears in my head i can still see your
Full of drugs and toxins
So I’ll stand up
Jealousy shows its ugly head once again

I am full of confusion, I am full of hate,
And you may be confused and have a fit
Enjoying this moment and all its individuality,
Soft and lonely eyes
Worth my laughter
Here i would like to tell you a story about this girl.

Friends don't ditch you
You were meant for me
so much that gonna change,
Give me your number?
about me and he wont tell
Our love for one another will keep us going, it will pull us through.
I guess that's the gamble we take.
I'm only 15!
Still covering are eras we cry
Where I have grown, learned and loved

maybe its not
Hoping someday
then now i come down from up above
i have myself to blame
The heart has but one
you don't deserve that gift,
Beneath it
Aching with nausea
While I loose all imagery.

the other day i called her phone
As you toss me aside
Now you dont need to worry
then a young boy the name of ben
So help me
So no one has told you,
I didn't do this to myself
Forget It Now
So I might wake up happy for once
I wish I could follow it, but maybe its just me.

I hope,
Just to forget
You made shelter on the sand,
It hurts to breathe without you
I know of an easier way out thats easier to see.

In your eyes
Stare into the darkness any longer, and
My own two hand from blood I spilt,
I can't tell you... that I love you.
Never being loved. The stress of living
the sun breaking through the clouds

My air.
I don't know. . .
Her faults.
And I could sing to you before the night
(This might be the last kiss)
*Blackened* to sulfur

like that day on the beach
from someone elses tears
I'm happy
SO i'll just lie here,
Should Now Become the truth.
but i said them to the wrong girl

>>>
I know I love you
about what exactly this life really means
† † † † † † † † † † † † Inhale,
Like a beautiful song of a siren
but you can feel them
Passion blooms, exploding all over my heart,
Here we are again

Are the people we dislike
The shattering of the windshield,
Merry Christmas Mr. Hurt me
He looked up at the man,
Do you believe
Oblivion will come?
To forget anything but the person
lets put that all aside
Is that why you ignore?
into a blasphemous confession of a mangled mind.

I dunk my head
had a heart attack only being 16 years old
I feel so rejected
Meet up at the Shell, and head to the special spot.
And my body was on fire
my heart is so weak
So untie the ribbon that has held them together

so say take me away
I struggle for something to hold on to
Think of the wind’s golden results
this cant take so long

cold.
The love I miss.
To fall asleep to tonight
Licking hungrily to the fullest height
like a knife
must of been his feelings after the local mortician tried
One moment can change everything

And I never knew love could be so cruel
obsession with the mechanics
mum doesnt NOE!
† † † † † † † † †and his skin was crawling with it.
Years of pain,
i got to go
Even if I don't become your wife
I ride him wild, taming the beast,

lips move as they raise a toast
In the depths of the sea
lead me to your heart..
But it was fate
i was jus played,used
Or feeling
in cheap vodka and dwindling cigarettes
if my lungs are filled with nothing
I won't bother you any longer
its something about the way she talks,

Nanny knitted Jumpers,
prove me wrong
is accurate.
Telling my self I promise, I wont give in I'll try,
For writing sideways
Because all i feel right now, is the depressful soul I have at night.
Shall it be a blade to slice my arm
Set it down on the floor
Is it set
He was not normal

The pictures won't fade
Battered and broken I am not the same.
and signed it with my name
My haven of safety has become my hell...never staying clean for long
Color Fades, Close Your Eyes,
Not here or now
And pain turns into weakness
They just don't know how to love

Earning another crack in the almost shattered looking glass
" the fairy tales lied " She's their Oh-so-fucked-up- paper bag princess
ME CRAZY!!
To thus discern and I shall try

no sound at all.
Just to let you know
and tried to f
Soiling my bed
I cannot cope

So stay
Thinking about you all the time
I always told you
I should still have at least one.
In this moment, i feel so alive
Against those who I sink beneath.

Are defaced by segregation.
Well, I've been dying
Redeem every tear
Because your not with me today

Missed
But some how he found me
no matter how hard you tried
I really thought you cared.
† † † † † † † † † † † † † † † In that kiss.
I've lost the best thing to me....
we kissed and kissed
Is a secret with no end or start
your life with out me..

Will now make us stronger
as it carries her to far off places.
just trying to earn her wings
Will you die with me?

I will never stop loving you,
but my best friend i hope your glad
i think i'll do it for you.
Tell me do you believe?
Head
The lights from jets
I didn't know what I was doing

Imagination runs wild with evil
A single rose amidst the shade
You Have Me Wrong,
Like you sucked the life out of me,

but there's just no words. In the end
And you made me scream
It's time to go
I don't even feel it,
I'm alone in this world
fast, quickly in your prime,
and I don't need your comforting touch

Out of breath but still there
saying "is it getting cold in here?"
Seeing you almost everyday,
Be everything I see.
And you'll see
i wish i was there with you, i wish with all my might
joke or not...it fucking hurts.

Maybe I'll wake up and perhaps not
they say im sick
Claiming you've been through
but all you can do is sit behind closed glass
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I stand alone.
The sky begins to cry with me and soon my body floods over
Could I help?

Deceased
and still say
[I could feel my heartbeat drop]
So far away you never even heard,
This holiday am I.

ur dead to me.
Though I pretend
I can envision the two of us together
Angered at the hesitation
take my soul
Nails to face
They don't notice how I feel
The feeling of abandonment

You never did?
love hurts you
either way it made you unhappy,
her voice
He's mine, not hers

they'll never come free.
Hurting is something that's normal
You melted
together we will win
Down on my bended knees in surrender,
stands on the ledge
Out and alone is where I must be.
waiting for the nightmares to stop
to make me feel like I belonged
Pull your eyelashes out so you can see

people say?
Do unto me as you want I'll only repeat this...
OK, well it wouldn't matter anyway...(i guess)
Remembering all the friends that showed me something
Understand their thoughts,
Light up one more cigarette
More love inside of him than i thought i ever deserved.
You can kill all my dreams
No-one will know,

i dont cut for attention i do it to feel numb
I know where it is.
I love you still
Nothing more to feel
You'll never find me here

I'm doing it all for you...
Tears fall as the
Suffocating on dust
And my friends became yours

I'm done with this rant
Up until the time we went out on a date
In your arms
i am this person

We are the ones that never could
but you pull it out from right under me
Nothing has made me wanna fight
Melting dreams
I stumbled upon a man of a special kind.
nothing
'A woman should never give their purity
become one another

Would You Kill For Us?
I guess they're so empty inside
She is blind
Though all this is sweet,
I love the way you hold me tight,
hopefully never too be awaken
More then to look ahead
I can't, and I won't.

Because maybe you can make that person like different people
and i try but im not convinving
Not sister
Time is all consuming
And to what you want.
No comfort to itch for.

Still secretly believing
Watched you walk away
this side of her.
A tear from a cry for whom died
† † † † † † † † † †Freezing the stream,
So deftly would be cut,
No?

Only to freeze into another layer of mindlessness
[You seem to want an excuse]
I knew I loved you, by the look in your eyes
Pleaze send me anything but signals that are mixed.................
Born of my regret
All I get is ridicule.
i ran the blade across my wrists
You wonder if it was all worth it
Weren't tied behind my back
When I'm wishing that this would blend?

Can anyone else do that??
Can you see my soul bleed.
That i would want to hold you
She will be his loving bride
and empty hopes

and think,
Candy, Candy, Candy
its hard enough being a normal 15 year old
Don't you try to change me with fucking lithium,
You start to scream at me
of laundry detergent
If you could take my hand would you promise to never let go?
I don't know what I
no one is crying, but I was lying....
Now I shall ravage him, taking everything else I can.

I was no longer scared.
Please don't hurt anymore,
DON'T CARE IF YOU LIKE IT
Am I really so blind
But for now i hide behind the mask.
Because if I wanted torture I'd do it myself
so cold and lonely now
But all the pain heartache hurting and sadness you bring
You're a good artist,
I'm not to sure

stop thinking
This is me
[but you own the place]
become more obvious
Will I ever get over it?
In hopes of being able
Can Tear me away from the battle in my mind,
Understand my mucked up far from perfect life

Hate me or ya love me
I'll sleep the day away
To contently quench
Cos that's wrong and I've been waiting far too long
Broken hearts and lost dreams,

Let him drip like a leaky faucet
And go...
† † †. . .Creeped in through the dirty white walls
Instead you hid in the shadows, too much of a coward to take a stand.
But who's to say that
Shaking back and forth
with the dying flowers in your hand,

nothing
Drip
and scars on her thighs bleed regret .
And not wish for revival
Then you turn around and you break mine

To cry on
I'm sorry it had to come to this
She loves him
its something about the way she walks,
And then saves her self again
I love the way you hold me tight,
Or the same place

caress my hips
A third time,
I'm still looking
and shake that a**
and as chills go down my spine
for you to walk on and out of this friendship you claimed you wanted

i pray,what i dream.There's

To change this

And it’s all your husband’s fault.

Sticking her nails into his heart
And my pain will disappear

In front of the whole world.

Every word you have ever said will scare me until I'm dead
Early in the morning

Lost in a nightmare,

Next day I followed her
inundating me with waves of gloom
Why cant we have fun times like we used to?

As the way I've fallen for you.
Still I think to myself there is a way,

All these creatures stirring in the Dark
Burn my past
Once upon a time, there was a little girl,
A new side of life
As I feel the rain
Framework and friction
And you can't see what is wrong with this
I'll Forget About The Life,
your life will flash before your eyes

I lean into the breeze
I love it and without it I’m boring and weak.

Consumed in excess during judgment’s lapse.

I promise to love you undyingly.
Imagining it's all for the better
Where what we were
On the way to the station,

Well I'll Make It Once Again,
The last night I'll ever spend with you

Instead of tears falling down my ace

Forget thy love and bless'dness,
Of Autumn's doleful daylight departure
Something unusual is inside me tonight
Parents that Dissagree,Do Not Approve.
She challenges its beauty with her own and gets it to submit.
Choke on the sickening scent of ash and smoke
Destroy the Source
I realize we're still very young
You sucked the blood out of my heart
Time may pass by, but I am that persistent demon that clutches to your dress.

I don't know what to do.
Take my place
Fell through the sky
A life you lead with someone to whom i've been replaced

Crying.
I just hope you know all of this
You left, dear,

Behind a weightless eye

Dreams of your "future" trickle down

Nothing.
This is the day and time
Filled with everything but happiness and glee.

Digging deeper for the lie that makes it right

All we wanted was her.
I am alone.

Six feet and two inches of skin and bones,
Beneath a wishing star
Why you don't just open your eyes and see

this cannot be.
You ignore me now
You are the worthless one,

For I have no control over this
while I'm still here on earth
All she does is absorb it,
I'll smile some more
and youve taken my knife
Die in this moment, and not a tear to cry.

Every time I'm with you
A cool breeze,
Romantic hearts start to break
I close my eyes and I see you,
You are my guardian angel.

But now as we discuss
It was cold this morning,
Starring at the ceiling
I guess I dont know much of anything.

But her crimson petals mark her pain
Here in the dark I can't see you walk away from me.
Is this how it's going to be?
From the window, light's peering through

i think i'll do it for you.
Make your ear’s bleed from the noise.

It hurt so much that screaming

Please Come Back

"what about grandma and mom?"
I'm sorry it had to come to this
'Poison, did not kill me,
and i will repay you with my soul"
You tell me the opposite of what I know to be.
Somebody to foot the bill,
Her heart is sinking in her chest

I wait for you until there is no more coffee in my cup.
I let your sweet talk guide me
Sometimes I wish
So lets not try to make up our minds
Except into my head, to break me down, but you aren't getting in there

But about time for moving on again
But the memories of the recent past had me depressed

Just so she wouldn't go through this

And pushed it out-

I still want to live.

Oh, but he was never concerned
And I would act like you were a thing of the past, a one-night fling,

As my dad walked out the door,

With these words

But if I let the pen and paper lie
Why lie to yourself,
Cool and relaxed

Quit it!
The insatiable demon devours them all,

Falling faster than the rain outside

Every time I'm with you
and my ahnds start to shake,
trying to embrace the pain,
I am able to feel no torment here,

happiness was all to real
Would you love me more?
by my side,
I'm dying inside
was it because i believed you loved me, you promised me true?
What have you done?
Slit through the skin again
A marvel,

I realize how
I had hopes of an 'us.'
So they are now drowning
Must have been the day that I met you,
where did you go?
So please just stay, atleast for me,
Go, I died inside!
I see my monster,
But if you choose them

but me.
You won't bring me down
Thinking of that thought
so tightly grasping the past

So Much I Can't Erase,
To wish to stay and play
I'm almost forced to hold my breath, when caught inside your stare
Replaced by a guy
My heart right out
Never seen nor heard,
Because I'm here for you...
You could share words of lust with me
let all the dead inside start beating
she dies alone now.

pulled back in.
Hurting people you care...
but u dnt noe shit!
and running around in underwear.
Drown in sadness.
I then gather up my books,
for breathing

But you stop me
I'm So Young,
I try to focus on something else
Suffering you way through life

Like you used to
Snow reflecting like the crystals in your eyes
Undressing the poetry
Hitting my hard I fall to my knees.
and nothing seems right
But my heart is safely with you,
Then lord knows I will not miss
I must choose
Destory All Those In My Way...
The piercing shrieks,

and i bleed to see this movie-life flash before my eyes
For her heart was broken
We are life
I need to feel you, to see you glow
Bashed and brusied,
Because you sure as hell seemed it.
Her mouth from ear to ear.
You said you could handle me this way
Like spitting on a raging fire
And in death find a life of freedom

Seeping into oblivion
Small and with a load of wannabe's
I AM NOT giving
When I hear you say 'I love you,'
The note explains my life regret,

I want to know why
Stitch up the halves of my broken heart
I hear you kissed another girl,
I Live to get burned.
DON'T EVER FIND ME

I see someone else.
why dont anyone listen
i would do anything for you *guitar chord*

The person who can confide in

And who will have
And you of course agree.
That girl changed the other girl's life.

There’s No Hope To See Me Through
You're on you balcony,

and tormentous pain in my heart
When you look at the wedding band
Now were we?
and get pleasure from your pain
For every day you are away I miss you less.
I close my eyes
Doubt...

To see what he’d do
I don't see myself as a child,
Care for them so much.
I take no heed in them.
Justice:
Trapped inside are lies,
You'll constantly question my feelings at hand
Will this pain ever end, I feel like hate will always win

Oh yea sweet thing
To Take Away All The Pain,
I watch from a distance
I miss the sharp scent of roses
For you I felt a feeling so strong,

Printing your looping signature
>>>
For days, for weeks, for months, for years
there was no good or unjust people
But it is not the good
I'm damned, I'll die. Pathetic.
Peace in my hear for once, at last,
I gave birth to your frustration.

I may seem like I never care, I may seem like a sore loser,
Maybe if the world would
Why did you stop?
Buried under our insecurities
Keep me off my feet
Dear God,
feelings for one are still there, i know

Fill it with a language unknown
Dying to get away to something familiar
I do love you for all that counts.

My eyes burn from these tears,
I look down; the puddle of black has reached my waist.
With friends and family
Of my blood trickling away

For you, I've died
But I was just going through the motions day by day.
Never laughing
I get up and it starts talking,
For you to sit right here.

Drowned in my rainy days.

It's not important to me
Gently gliding her hands on him
Disguised in truths,
Perfectly written
Where is my family

To do or to die
Their families have been longing to tear them apart.
I've been in all these years
why doesn't the world just crash down?
Trying to make something so wrong maybe go right
Reaching for something I cannot feel

I will not forget any of you in my dark days
And sleep fills the eyes,
Love, wont you
to keep love alive
Well I'll Make It Once Again,
'We aren't a family, are we?'
And do whats wrong back to good
I die.
Cannot be found

with the Spade,
But you just ignore me
As the weeks go on and seasons change you drift slowly from my thoughts.
And when we are
And more beautiful than any flower I have ever seen!
I have felt heart-ache before,
No longer wanting the Hurt,
whenever im not okay

This is me
Just like you should
Broken by the power of love and guidance
And I’ll fall
A pebble's just a pebble on the bank
I'll always be insane till I'm dead

ill pray for your ill never wanna make you sader.
On that beach,
It used to be so tangible
Everyday is the same
Does my Smile Relive your pain?

while I'm licking my wounds
For us to only have each other
Your mom won't let you date him

A mix of two perfumes collide in the air
You hide me from the light.

No heaven,
to call my own
Never For you!
A natural smile cannot be brought
Driving down the road to something unforgettable
People flitting about the streets,
The pain within me burns me alive
The tears streaming down my face

That's how you make me feel
† † † That's the closest to Magic,
We lied beside each other
Take away all my pride
The dad and daughter having a fun time
Once in a lifetime good oppertunitys rise,
But their gift is just another scheme...
Why can't I be happier?
For God to answer her prayers
Pass light speed

I knew right then
And the fall is too much to bear.
and said the words i needed you to
My vocal chords cut
Just to know you're
I stand outside shakeing fromt the cold air,
I cant live without you
And if you ever wonder why

The looks you throw my way.

To me, this is...it?
We knew this was the end.
No hope on the horizon

I'm not a slut
You've left me no choice

Pure and Unfeeling

Did you know that simple words can make such a difference,
Asphault be thine name,
i love that girl to death !!!!!!
Dark swirling clouds
When my innocence flew out the door
I can't go back I can't change the hurt in me...I can't change hurting you
you hit depression

I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I just wish you could see
Can i be that drug?
Gaze deeper and you can see,

I'm still listening
i wear my mask and help her the best i can
but I will try
The glassed sight stay dry

And surprised I was, when with love he reacted.
Mask your demons, mirror none

They make mistakes here and there
Rustling gently through the trees
As she tries to picture

We'd play outside,
This isn't how it should be,

Because so many out there got it 3x worse
most of all they hurt me
in the moonlight, I can fly
No help came for me, and for that I am lost......
Lost in deceit
I never could repay.
Will my attackers ever let me rest?
I'm getting sick of this fast,
ive purged my last meal

Assented by the youth themselves,
GOOD BYE MY LOVER GOOD BYE MY FREIND
And devours me.

I can't stand this anymore
Promise me you'll never let go, promise you wont,

In this waltz

I liked it best here
because i know you.
Spilling in my thoughts
In the end you said you didn’t love me
Screaming I love you inside of my head
i can't have this anymore
WHEN I CALLED YOUR NAME
and left me for dead
Giving In,

And it works
It's another complaint
I don't want to tell anyone what I think
Oh, I hope today- you're only putting up with me
Watching the sun as it dies

pain is evil, pain is mean
And I have
But it did hurt
Hello
But you can't see my eyes anymore, and it's drowning me
FOREVER PUT AWAY
Missing wings
Never got to tell you

Two loves?
my brother is going to jail
Is it one of your all time perks?
You're right fucking place

Shoot a bullet at the sun
And remember the night we got so stoned
because you wish you were somebody else
Need to return it...

The friends and family that love you will always suffice.
I wish we could do it again once more
Pulling down
When you laugh so hard,
i know you dont care what
Maybe I fell asleep,
Then smile as I listen, to your blood curdling cry.

There, we live in sin.

To death
You could always make promises Is really what makes me...Me
For you, I've died

but i still cant feel alive
And I frequently look around

To watch my anger drain,
You hurt me in the past,
they dont care aout me
One purpose had been served by this dead man,

Trees of stories are large with life.

Every damn day,

When I started on the sidewalk the rain started to slow
But I'll never stop loving you
I'm weak and depressed, every morning having my memory refreshed
she know's it's almost over .
What do you do when all you are is alone,
I want you to tell me your deepest secrets
Baring down
You can't reprimand
I grew up in a land of no dreams
Never meant, wanting to go insane.

Everybody but me!..

Thanks for the love

Kiss you tonight my love?

When you say that you love me

I see the way you look at me,

I had to draw the line,
For something you never thought you could again,
But then you leave and then I fear
I can't forget evil's touch, I can't erase my past

I can't believe you did this
death calls but without name,
The death she yearned for-beyond her reach,

It hurts me you know to hear you say

I admit that I am forever far from perfect,
maybe,
I'll be one less thing to worry about
Sweetheart, I swear it - I've moved on for real now.

You can be a whore,
We parted, because of you, and your sinnful mistake.

This thought of a friendship

what an ugly display.

Her aunt holds her once more,

Think of all my want to
you were never there welcome to my end

I listen to all and remember things
It's just that you didn't think it through
Its then we can win,
With all my heart
Between immunity of hearts
so where is mine?
Finding out these things,
the birds fly away...
I feel close to you, so connected.

I may seem like I never care, I may seem like a sore loser,
Just for one last time

And you never see her again...

We waited a lifetime.

Oh look!
And you fall to you knees
Run through the dark
So you there, standing alone in the dark,

I know now you really didn’t mean it

A poem from a lovers heart will gracefully unwind,

Hanging on to broken threads of cotton
When you are away, missing you becomes tears,
Hope is gone.
The decades pass

Living life on the edge.
I'll give you roses and try to be a beautiful as they are
and has no hope
Yes,

I'm leaving and never looking back
To make it through I cry and cry
December and how it will
Now I see you lieing there,
You've broken my heart once again

Your skin begins to feel as if it is ripped apart,
all echo from my past.

It's so hard to love again,
Baby I'm going to miss you
Although many ignore it still
Like a drop of honey
Just for you.
I want to keep these moments,

Screaming for me
Nobody notices you
and enjoy your Highschool Hell.
Turned into a lover of a dream that is unbelievable
...children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by...
The holes in my innocence allow you seep into my heart
At me they come, these living Shadows

No, didn't think so
Your sisters never there
I'm alone in this world
To tough to be queen.
Kill me now and i will be free

I know I can always come to you
Though its been forever and a day
Another leaf that falls
This thing that you call happiness
Something soft- Of grace

So many ìWhat ifî questions ran rapid through my head
to say what you did has hurt my pride
I will save myself
And Its wicked cute when you shake your toosh at me,
n anact war agnst myself

Sit in a corner
I'll scream this guilt one last time
There's no pressure
I'm alone again
Again.

I see her face
There are so many questions

please i just want to be free
Prove to me I'm just the same,
I will never fall

Away from me, I cannot breathe.
These feathers do not flutter
You have no views.
I seem to see myself, But I can't really tell...
I couldn’t believe what I was seeing
Caused me grief
Staring at the ground

I played in the fields as a child
Just a single line in your book

then people tell me to kill them.

she'll give him what he wants

As steam fill my nostrils.
The hatred in your heart
You ask me if I want to spend the rest of my life with you,
but I back away and fade back into the past
I am always learning about her

And its all because you love me,
I can't see
Does anybody care?
Once again its dark,
Daddy,
Why can't you just tell me you love me?
you seem to be no less than perfection
HE=peasant
So don't try and fix it,
The only boy I ever wanted,

Understand me (understand me)
You try to stop this madness
going wrong in my life
Life has given me all I know
Looking at myself,
Broken Below, Broken Above,
so you might not say a word
But really I'm by myself, and this smile is a toy,

Looking for the good in humanity
and I just let your love pass me by.

Along with my life

I Can't Even Cry

But you made one too!
And the words that were exchanged

Die today he must!
and i know thats ok
im so angry n sad
My body starts shaking, I find it hard to breathe
This time they'll care,
She said she owed you something
But silence is her new voice

But I know I am what you desire
You stand there and
You've loved
May heaven bless your grave.
Even if I plan to perform suicide . . .

We can sleep until

Your unfinished work

Lost in a world of my tormented mind
The darkness of blood
as those around me.
I wanted to go
Fell down

No matter what could go wrong.
You would always tell me id still be pretty even if i was 200 pounds.
Won't Let You Plant Your Seed
Cause every time we danced

You know what I am saying,
I will love you with all my heart forever,
But I didn't have a clue

I remember all the times, I wrote my thoughts down,
She started to scream and cry

You're always on my mind. You don't know
Just let it go (please just let her go)
There was a game
And I intend to say
waiting for a voice to call out
you simply tripped,
but if you knew what I was feeling
We had great times
crawling across my wrists

School won't be the same
I show you all my scars and you help me through.
That's just like me, I will run away

with all their ugliness inside
So highlighted, so permed.

or was it planned
Guardian of your heart

ToRn FlEsH
To why you'd so such a thing
And never worrying if they would leak,
know it affects me,the things that you do but they
Fill the holes in their unsatisfactory lives.

I can try to fill my cracks
The truth that hurts the most,
might injure me to inability
I’ll give you all the attention you can stand
and birds fly somewhere to escape
With two slits here and one knot there
Crimson found
I was head over heals
losing this feeling
too loud

but for making my friends happy,
I'm empty around you, because you make me so blue
When did the truth become the lies
When you laughed and you talked
just to talk nothing Else
I breathe
like it does now

Had died from the dose
You blame yourself, my foolish love,
I can see them move in the Dark
You'll never find me
Why won't the darkness let me be
My smile is really my frown
All I have left are memories,
The light of my eyes once there now gone

I'll wait for you here
How do I,
And now i do mo'
I'm in a room filled with hate
I've just simply had enough
I'm hiding from the world
I'll put your heart in my pocket,
we wrot you never told me!!!

But they were more like dreams
What if this life is just a dream?
So come a little closer, love,
Sometimes art can’t save you
Will I ever know?
Think on it now
and when the drugs were gone and the party was over

You are my love, The one.
so you all can go on regretting you ever met me.

Played lightly
But deep down I know you wouldn’t
Ever so gracefully
i prayed so hard and long, but would my prayers be heard?
How can I?
I didn't know love could be

because of my own anger,
I spin so fast
I ask you not to ask to much,
It hurts to ignore.
Why does she think she can do this?
Becuase I'd Surly Kill For You.
Please Come Back
One which has my mark

There I lay
Now I fall
When I think about you all the time?
Is true love consuming??
All because of him I feel miserable
Remarkable,
To show him the real me
My Prayers Will Be Cast Away

One other is the brains,
Your arms around me tight
Are like poison to my aching soul.
I'll leave this place at the least,
And fears,

Make this right
Nothing stops me...
The sounds,
One I need.
Even if I knew you, at one time at least, had cared,
I wish you were here today
I can't cut it out with this razor blade,
Unknown are your feelings

Am I really alone?
(evil laugh,not retarded laugh.Muwahahahahaha)
always feeling like your being stabbed in the back
this is Emily's song
im empty...

Am I here?

Whishing to spend with you,all of my days.

Your eyes tell me
Spinning round and round

I wish it didn't have to end like this but,
That if you give a guy your heart
I'm ready to come home
Wasted my life away into nothing
I thought it would be easy, but nothing ever is,
How I'm a terrible daughter
Repeatedly
Words kept, promises come true,

Now I sing
The more tears I cry.
i have myself to blame
I weep of bliss, for I have found, that which makes me whole.
No matter how small
He had her trust
Within the night I hear your beating heart,
And run into the worst collisions?
A heart beating in the floor, it's beginning to Roar

Bombs going off,
i dont think i can hold on much longer
Ever have that happen?
Is with words intertwined.

We'll wait for the truth
do something to take
make it all okay.
Live in Beauty and Truth
it is to say farewell
And as they lower me into the ground
I just want to close maself in,
Be near as I fall.
Do you see the sticky spot I am in,

Show yourself!
The same or not
of these emotions
Of terrors and nightmares that cloud my head
End of Author Entry
im sick of the bullshit people put me through
that we would say I do,
would kill me.
I sigh

And so I chose to stay...
cause she's an average angel
As though I am surreal‚Äô
the red streaks running down my arm
Tripping over dirt-clods,
No longer can I pretend you're mine
Waiting for you
noone around
I try not to let it be destructive
Behind my door,

And it’s not fair
im always on your mind .
I was in awe
you can slit my throat.
while I walk oblivious
xxx
i might be okay .

To describe everything that I’ve heard
You never know what possibilities
I was beautiful
The hold the weak when they act strong,
I wonder really,
To be broken.
I'm caught up in. With the Beautiful laughing
When everyones in smiles,

my closet.

Confused
she makes me wanna be with her
Victory was mine
The wiser man seems younger,

You are my sunshine for when im cold,
I feel safe
im afraid
I can't stress the fact
† † † † † † Only worrying about wasted years
And you hardly seem to notice.
One couple new for sure they were getting married

Just as bad as you do
Aint no sorrow in tomorrow
What god has in store
I've been here before...

you had
Watch me bleed for you
Haunt my soul,
you can never change it
For death to take me aside
I am a rhyming addict.
We will make it through this one day
too much hope and just not enough weed..

fulfil your nightmares
I wish would find it's place
So poetically.
My dark side seems to shadow, my nightmares become my dream.
College-town, laughing with his friends,
strangled
So check it out =)

Skin is pale and lifeless from such unforgotten phobias
What am I really?!
Hardly solid
It's not really me,

pile of ash
And that room full of people,
I wish i could take you back
I didn't though, I gave you a chance

and die.....
That you'd be much better
why he loves me so much.
I'm smiling at the sight, so bright - alive.

Why lie to yourself,
My PerSona of cold steel
From these shadows,
About my secret
so every night she slit her wrist
i give up i quit!!
This isn't hilarious
turning blue

Thank You

Maybe she wants be alone and free
hand i never wanted it to end,but sadly it did.
The scars on my arms,

and wash over my skin with your hands
I'm your girl
becoming one with the pond below
My question is have they been where I've been?
Might have a REAL
Im not gonna give you what you want,
this is my goodbye
I know I can talk to you....
...I know on the inside

i dident do nothing
We can't wait for Our Love to be set free.

I know I should feel low
Used to be
now im all alone
"You Need to Die"
A girl of nothing but greys...
Pretend nothing went arye

We've got a long way to go
Its hard to believe
Deflowered in breath
That was when I knew
That is what you have,
im alone and forgotten...
My hopes were so high
With forever
Confinied in a box the questions keep coming
For you, as time

A place to call my own,
I take you as my husband
dont you just feal like loves is just a hoax?
i know your the man.
Aching, Cutting, Hurting
Was heaven on Earth

Scars left broken
I love my peter dearly and hes been hard to live without,
I cant hold onto you anymore
Containing corporate whores;
or you could be happy for tomorrow
Souls becoming one
of needles
I'm Really Right Here...
Take me to where I want to be
Not here where there is so much pain

A B+
The feeling of water, where did it come?
New name: X Like A Sunset X
To me!
† † † † † † † †Soft Pink Chunky,
It lies so beautifully when I'm not listening
Now that I contain
You are gone forever I fear.

My heart has spaces
just to talk nothing Else
Covered with chocolate,
Tonight is the best night

But it did
Draining thoughts
it will keep me forever
i don't have screams
but our bare feet
I regret it all. I'll never quit.

yeah nothing this good stays true
than anything before
I'll keep quiet
Kill the Need For Laughter.
you be the needle
to stay away from broken people

wrong with me, wrong with life, and wrong with what i've done
Rest on the moon.
So here we go again,
And irony, dressed in a neon pink gown
walking in three minutes late
Or up
I want to care for you and always be there for you,

Months of neglect have left you weakened
When the lines were dulled
And then we will be fully alive
matter begins to slow
Both couples have made it past a year being together

Stoner girl .
I ask of you to be honest
Flaws invisable for now.
And as it does my soul depletes.
Than i knew you

I WANTED TO BE WITH HIM
† † † † † † † † † † † † † †Sigh,
So, I'm sorry, I'll go out with you.
my love for you was so real, so whole
A sea of sleep
to hold a falling Angel
And eyes that sees only for you
there's nobody that cares
The parting sorrow

Forgive me twins,
and it would all be okay
Her eyes hold secrets,
And you can whisper things to me
But I just didn't want to believe
The pain within makes me die
Rather, I saw him smile.
Hot air fills my lungs.

When will you finally see?
Then all the next day
That hate there own lives
look
i had you
Who would have guessed we'd talk for hours

...what have i done...
she's an average angel
I can't feel your hugs anymore Cody,
Day and night,
I need you so bad right now

I start
Raised on pop art and lies,
Is it worth it??
Once I've found you and your life is over,
You still have something hidden

on Love's altar
with losing so many loved ones
No one rushes to fix me this day.
To ease away the dying pain
I won't stop for begging

since I'm not that benign?
I love how your never afraid to never be afraid ,
He let out a huge fart
I will shout out so loud! I know that I will be standing there,
He just left me here

I would reach out to you
Up and over.. Easy!
The next day
A sense of meaning
Will I ever feel safe, safe from myself?

Sorry, my heart feels this way.
And took all of them from the plate
Typing my fingers away
Peaceful
what did i do that was so wrong ?
I hesitate!
Than a irritable ache

Had lost its flame.
That I will like...
Another of the many on my list
She Openend Her chest and Gave him her heart.
that made me cry everyday
My lord mounts his pretty sub, as he prepares to breed.
I hate myself now,
Torturing me, telling me to do this.
Piercing screams fade through holes in my consciousness

hoping the next day will be better
And the people that will always be there
Good night
I can't hide from it anymore
at least I might as
Knowing someone can only love once,
me, with forgotten friends
You
Yes,
And tender lips

I yell, "I WANT TO PLAY!"
with the right kind of remedy.
They are my security
Left me out of it's pages
† † † † † Such a wonderful sensation.
These pages of broken hearts
This is not reprisal..."
With this distance in my eyes
Because you hurt me so much

I know these words
Now I will begin with a pause
and I cant take it
Lost Little Girl
I want out
It's her fault
This reoccuring conflict
Or so it seems

Or do you look at me with disgust;
and my body lays motionless.
When I come home
Always shining

Your always the one I compare him to
Except into my head, to break me down, but you aren't getting in there
Being Placed In The Ground,
torn and slightly worn
words into a silent night,
now your gone and im alone
nothing but a creak
Do I have to spell it out(Would that be better)
I can feel tears filling my eyes,
the question of her perishing faith now vanished from her mind

Miraculous,
Your time has not come,
She’s wrapped herself in thick blankets
You
He didn't answer he just cried too
I could never describe through words
But you just can't
I need to see him before I blow

Alone...but surrounded.
The tension growing
Was always promised
To go to school with you
but the cards are laying on the table,

part by part
room.
I see my demise
I love you too.
Not afraid, not feeling, not knowing
is that
Every shred of this masterpiece burning on the floor
and swallowed the key.
Pushing away from him I would hold on to this resignation

So farewell all my "friends" in the town of crack.
To our own little paradise
In a time when
The sun isn't as bright

and I could touch you
I see you're sorry
What we once shared
I hope you understand
as filth ferments flesh
The more I become weak.
Why can't you just tell me you love me?
He was running from a past he wished to forget,
Do you ever wish that I was there to calm your frights?
it could be legendary

The only boy I ever wanted,
No care of what the furture brings
I know now your thinking
everything scary just go away .
someone I'm not if i don't know who i am
Thought I was lost but I was stranded

† † † † † † † † †You put me through.'
Let's endure,
you were a good friend to me
Lonely nights so close behind,
With Little Strength I Try And Keep You Safe,
Come clean with everything?
Piiicker U there?
All that is left, is the
they call me brilliant but disorganized

a virus
Free Your Sins, You Can Pray,
Tossing and turning
We were together only
drowning in my tears
So that I may forget you
And even as he lays burning
Decision is blurry
slit my throat

With the pills called love
that you where always there
Love does not not boast
i have had feellings
Is there a reason why
and its too bad
so far away
† †to feel this way.
xxx

The way you smiled
Some harder days,
I thought I'd found my paradise.
I'm bored,
But you can't love a person
To hang up your dress
Lost all the time
I probably won't be able
Hundreds of corporate whores,

Living life as a lie
Allowing me to have my own emotions.
So dont you tell me forever and always, because I know my heart will bend.
A mear infatuation grown past our deadly resurrections.
But everyone loves candy
The feelings that I hide,
That they be closer to last winter
[Do you even believe me?]

i was raped
The shoelaces...
I watch it gaze off into space,
no joy
and you feel like a statue moving
After you escape
i still see your smiles and i kringe my fist
Though most of it is a lie

trying to sleep my life away
were the
I loved u so
Masquerading all night

Needle in the lung
Without making a sound
One of these days
If I try hard enough,

the paranoia controling ones mind
Words day in and day out.
will forever remain in me.I
You wanna know why I do the things I do?
I’m tired of been negative
And knows what the problem is,

I know I’m not all that cool, not even that great.
looking at myself in the mirror...
your fingertips
I hear out different things
To feel alive
Not to love you
shes a wanna-be beauty queen
to anything and everything
DO not shun us for we practice,
Of the judgement I lack

only you could do this
Just peachy,
BUT I HAD ENOUGH
I was so little I didn't even know how to read or write
.........nothing at all.................
If I even knew what love was before I met Him...
That I'm all alone
The dryad ducked away from me.
but no one will ever notice

Emphasized of dried leaves to symbolize
It always made me think alot
When you look up tonight
so together we can fight this,
Even if it feels slightly bare
As my life falls, to rock bottom in the dirt and mud.
Not the usual me wishing myself dead

Remind me,What Life Feels like,
My feelings lost,
The true me is showing again
How can I trust in one who has no reason to feel for me?
Were ever I may go,
money now clouds the judgement

The people bow to your words with out a sound,
in that nightmare,
God O
I make another slit.
Within the flames of this hell
There's no such thing as friendship,
† † †Its you.
I want to be in your arms
Were elses can I go,
Make the tears all shed

You'll never feel the same
I don't have
You’ve already caused me pain, just cause a little bit more.
Look familiar?

That's why I cried tonight
I could make you think that it doesn't matter to me at all.
I wont give myself away
my dear angel
I will think of that later after I got
The face of death and conquer my dismay.
I say yes to avoid another not necessary fight
what am i?
Holding on by a string
They accept me for me, in a way they never would.

there is so much pain
It can destroy you, but time is precious
and
Is the person who made you cry?
Snow reflecting like the crystals in your eyes

The day you told me you liked me
Why? Why do have to leave me?
Ugly
[It feel to the floor]
The stories it tells
Starring at the ceiling
Taken apart and tied back together

Her touches paralyze
He says he still cares,
I thought it was real.
You made me look innocent
Filling up your lungs
Too late?
i would hunt for the fault until your
So far away, yet I know you are near.
How much I felt that we had shared.

are only so
your happy
for you,
When I am done I come up only to collapse once again
*Chorus*:
But if I wasn't so damn shy, I'd drive to you just to see your eyes
closing my eyes i can
I thought this was a sweet romance, but it was not

Far above my head I see a small light
Look what you've done!
^we^ fit together
Never did I think
Maybe you did,
The trenches are dug and the armies are set

I wonder bought my unlived life
† † † †And they held each other until she stopped crying. †
A life scarred by the past
Are carefully kept

Me and said "I love
How he used to make me feel
the only light. . .the glow of the stars.
to meet him
But if I made you think like this
we collide...
My only murder;
Pretending not to cry
the sadness was underground,

So as we swallow our Pride,Kiss Each Other Good Night,
Hardly the case,
And you're just learning to have faith.
I've forgoten your awesome power and how you help.
[something with animal crackers in hand] masquerades,
I'll still be the same
the rough waters pulled us

I thought you loved me once
The smell is sound
If I wasn't such a coward,
Out a way to tell you how I feel
the future
Patiently painting the portrait
verb and even adverb.

ive lost my soul
23/09/1987
I wish I could see you instead
If only...
With emotion...

Upside down your driving
Then you turn around and you break mine
the world is killed with hurt and pain
Lying in your arms,
I started a fucking war today

from her beloved
The Nightmare I Shall Unleash...
I'm lost in this dream
And bury my eyes in my knees

Let’s remember our feelings to make it tonight
The ground embraced me, the sky shined it's light
sleep
For the sharp pains in my back
after 75 stories.
Poured over the summer glance
He says that you say
Beautiful in its horror
To reach beyond the limits of my embrace
She's done...

BUT NOW I KNOW I DO
Funny how only bleeding,
She cries herself to sleep, wondering of the girls he has since known.
. . .Because then we could see the stars.
THEY WILL NEVER COME BACK

No one to kiss.
What about me? Does anyone care?
Point the gun to my head and I'd thank you for doing the best
Black as night
All we were with what we’ll never be

Promises
Each mile farther was a mile
Repeatedly
Because you're my home

The reflection I see makes me want to turn my head away
to get to know you.
And bury my eyes in my knees
Because you dont know any other road.
ëWould you mind if I came to visit you sometime?’
I'm just scared
I guess not
i couldn't be your perfect son
Could This Angel...

I breathe
if you're emo and you know it slit your wrists.
Please be with me
Caress my bloody skin
Where you can touch me
Drip

your actions speak enough
I’m always in someone’s way....
And I love you still
You left me to fall..

† † † †No fights,
I feel like jumping up and down
I am not as stupid as you wish me to be
drenching rainstorms which bring new
And knows how he feels inside
tragedy it seems
No one will ever be the same

Pooring into a river of depression, Only drowning in fear
And up the mountain again
I know you will still love me
I cause the pain in my journey to help.

But don't be scared
And burning BrEAking feet
but know as the blood drips down my hands
So if you say it first

she keeps everyone updated
He always knew just the way to look at you...
i miss the way you held me and spoke to me with kind words.
You make me feel so happy
What sick organism is amused by us?
Hold me forever...
Can it be?
Life flows free in a river of blood,
Hiding all emotions, faking the mirthful look

Then suddenly the sky, OUR sky
You refuse to accept
a interesting conversation on MSN Messanger,
I think about death
Slipping away

dark and light dagger
now I only bleed mud)
Definitely a girl, just turned sixteen
She hates herself, and everyone too
I cant be,
I breathe you

Memories of friends
† † I sat,
To kiss you once again.
I lay in my room
† † † † † I plunge my hand into the murky water. . .
But its not going to work and thats fo' sure
i know you way too well, and i can see right through
But soon I realize it's just a dream
When we met,
The one that you need to hide from

trust, truth, forgiveness, and compassion.
People who give
I never wanted it to come to this
Your body mangled
To be more then close
The heart I swallow
im such a failure
And I you you'll see
but my heart is cold
I saw lightning and closed my blinds

Driving
Hugging
Covering up the fear they felt inside
You'll be my guide
Well then why am I
† † † † † † † †In front of her teacher.
But you'll all be awake
In your mind

together,
It's beyond Martin Luther, upgrade computer
see right through me or
I always pretend to be alright and never be hurt.
Not listening to her was a huge mistake.
but his mic was never on

It starts to turn hollow,
Leaving me in the dark
As well as tear me apart
in the park one day.
Ever since we broke up I am emotional
NoÖ it’s still there.
I will see her again.
Come back to my arms
Tears running constantly over a lover who can't choose
i will always

You won't bring me down
In the background of the nightmare
Bring up good points.
AND I KNEW THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
then we wake
in the dark
I come here to be alone

I can't help how I'm feeling
I mean nothing to you
Something that I could not mend
I drag my nail across my wrist
i cannot help but laugh when what's lost will never be found
SO PLEASE I BEG YOU BEFORE YOU KILL ME
Is that too much to ask for?

I start to twirl
NOTHING MATTERS CAUSE I'M ALL ALONE
I'll be there to hold your hand
[Soon] I'll be dying in your arms;
I ment it, every time
Stop pretending to be
On trips and the Internet are some.

ive just started having fun
she hates her life
Sadly it's true
I walk down the halls

to show you our love
Look deep into my eyes,
I would try to hold back my love
We sit hand in hand

I miss the way that when I looked at you,
Losing all is foolish pride
Tonight, she’ll try to forget it,
Always ditching me
Cause it's not just me who hates you,
is no lie's and no promises that you
I withdraw
this was my last goodbye
Would you love me just as long?
I am isolated

Get High.
A shadow
The crimson trickle pleased her.
Dressed for the occasion -
i stumble and i fall .
Another's lust,
Pretty soon

take it from me, i know
Words can be heard from behind
The color drains from my body and on to the floor around me.
and I'll become deaded.
In utter silence
exactly how I feel,
Swelling up, naming the truth as lies in my brain.
Book, book, book-----
Who would have thought
Maybe it'll be better?

Say whatever you want tonight (i don't care)
Nothing is the feeling that overcomes me as I stare off into space
before I die!!! "I LOVE YOU"!
to count on he's
From a Sunset to a Sunrise
And just stay like that too?
When we saw each other
† † † † † † Just your own vanity.
I can't bare to see you go.
We will forget all that you saw, we will create new beliefs.

I'm trying
Past the doors which they were locking.
If you want me
Why'd I do this?/
Broken Together, Broken Apart,
From my life fallen

he turns out like all the rest
Its too late, I can't get out....
So these tears I cry
four members in all
exactly how you feel
They can make you the unwanted trend
I always want to look, to be sure,

To wish to stay and play
I can't feel my heart anymore..
I lay
You may now claim what is yours. You may kiss.
an invaluable friend
but i cant.

You never lie
On the verge of jumping
constant stares and tears
If I don’t put a close on this,
Time painfully ticks away,

The good times we had
Our hug needs to last or I might even put up a fight
Clark and I jumped up and ran for the door!
Into death we crawl
Scared yet aware he exceots her Heart.
You listen and take off my
My feelings are shattered upon this bloody floor

and tell me how pretty my hair is
seeming to dictate...
I'll take my chances.
that you mean the world to me..
And I know what things are like now
And already only hours later, my depression has peaked.
Me too!
Yet I still get yelled at
We will all surely miss you

But somehow
For you, I've died
Weeks, months, years will pass I'll be the one you forgot
. . .Of my broken heart.

Can you comfort my pain?
you know she's far from sobber .
to fail and people to starve
It feels revolting To be in my skin As my body rots From within
Along my arms.
when those whispers haunt your dreams,
I'll never forget the feeling
>>>
If I could do that one last time

Disrespect and asshole
What I did in the past I'm not too proud of it
Proclaimed beautiful by her red
Is true.
Red rose, the last color of the sunset we watched.
But it would be a lie
A splintered figure taints the truth
Who can i turn to,
you can't find your

And as I ponder on my actions,
When I am with
so now 2 innocent lives are gone and deceased
you were my best friend.
You lie to me and to your husband..
you want to be friends?

What if we never met,
The hatred in your heart
and i dont know how to pick myself up
And I was a LITTLE chunky.
I cry.
And nothing more
Every time you cross my mind I melt
The black waters fills my lungs
YOU KNOW ILL DO IT AGAIN

Well this story is completely and utterly true.
for I was killing myself all along
but with nowhere to run
I'm sure they'll see.
kiss them
with out any care at all.
At least I guess you thought so at the time
I cant move
I'm weak and depressed, every morning having my memory refreshed

or if they'd be relieved
Pretending her eyes haven’t met my own
How can you love me?
. . . .whatever that was supposed to be.
What must I do to not be forgotten?
Know that they have names,
What invoked such bitter hostilities towards me

† † † † † †It stopped being so misty. . .
This is driving me crazy
So innocent like a child,
I've been picking up the shattered pieces of my past.
I'm a fool
Black Tears Stream Down her face...As her Love is in Mind.
Pretending everything ok I’ve already been down that road

she jumped into the pool
I'm looking at you
To you I will be true,
and are echoing into the floor.
Don't dream

But my whore of a mom
also to the others
and in his arms so tight
Now I can hardly bear it,
Yet it seems you never
he who caused the pain
Missing the memories of my childhood, starlight summer skies
The sky opened up that night
The beautiful perfections traced upon her face

I don't want to end it
The crimson trickle pleased her.
Keanna's words popped into my head then
This is me
they'll never suspect
Eager and alive

I sit, silenced.
hmm....guess this info was too big for ur overinflated ego.
Hanging on to broken threads of cotton
Jealousy sometimes owns it all,
It's all in my eyes
confuse the shit outta you...
A voice that would sound until dark hours of the night
Every time,
Within the core of an instant

Help me up a little
After a night of distress
Slowly killing oneself
Could lift the load of many forms of strife.
The memory joins me in my misery
You are to me a flawless reflection
Reaching For The Top...

as she kissed my life away
running in fields of gold with laughter array
I know that your the one,
From your friends that once liked you
Although I wish I'd not.
so soft
Making space inside for things i know are right,
My heart was broken and the days were long.
The silence is left unbroken
Dams falling into the flooding of our dreams

the seams
fresh sun flowers slowly replaced
.III.
They know the way
He was loved by his friends,
The moment we had
Before I fell for more deceit
And cry and cry

How could you have left me?
That I love you
Her touches paralyze
He waved and then grinned.
even though you were bound,
WHY

Because our love
Than why did you have to die
Just a beginning
You use the
but the Dark dares me to leap
How can you be so near

As I speak You stair Longingly into my eyes.
The reason
I cried for you
to cover up my stupid face
No More Wanting To
Some shouldn't be so sought.
The scent of your clean hair will do
Crosses your X's
Where what we were
To decipher such a thing

interupting ones thought
I've been picking up the shattered pieces of my past.
your life with out me..
I'll show you a side of me that's hidden beneath
A secret they would keep,

not their friend...at all
We rise up today
The fight ceases to desist.
I do.
Why does he keep doing this!
why dont anyone listen
You've come to life
shroud the heavy air.

I’d Gladly Give Up My Earthbound Life
was that she was now alone.
This scar won't fade like you did
You life is just perfect
goodbye
Noooooo!!

Or heading onto the road of love
We were destined to go wrong,
Leaving forever,
Your so strong and I'm just a 4 year old girl.
Sure lock your doors and try to run,

has a boyfriend, and its not me...
Once this life is over
It was never like I wondered
I let you go.
weeping in her ear

and surround myself with desperate screams and muffeled cries
you have eyes for her
That cannot save me
I don't want to lose you

I've waited to long,
To make the children frown.
hoping you don't realize i'm here in the oblivion
Crying to each other, when

And you are tired of waiting for the rain in this drought?
I really don't know what to say...
Hard times hit us
Aint no sorrow in tomorrow
Stay with me and make my dreams come true.

regretting that they ever met me
I always had to look after you,
Would know or is it obvious
By the look on my face
never knew this was pain
I'm letting myself fall deeper in love bit by bit.

She saw one day the devil come,
One day I love you the next I'm not sure.
But colors now flash exfoliating,
and treated me like dirt.
You showed me friendship when you let my little brother tag along.
She is the girl
ìMy life is falling to shit
But still, I cant run to the door
A simple toy, or
i know i should tell you how i feel

Right through his silky, brown hair
her mask, her mirror
Just like the heart
I wait for the truth
Because this should be the end.
Ill always have something to hide,

the beat of his heart began to fade.
Mom and dad were crying and couldn't stop.
i used to have a purple bedrooom,
Love, Life, Fear, Death

just to save her
She strokes the gun and dreams of Death,
That you see in your world
You are the key to the box I've shut,
Here it comes
Through all the hatred and spite
more lies
i speak words of nonsense...

Popping Pills,
Polish and silver
Chorus
You can create
and his body as a bed
Or is it just my perception on life, and this gimick,
† You sit alone,
Her lover won't come sailing home.
Two hearts united to be one
My love for you will blossom all year round,

theres nothing to fear
How it makes a stupid choice
At that picnic
i miss my nanna, ryan and phillip

I cried so hard
Love is in the first kisses
Perhaps I'm just accustomed to the frog.
Whispering my last good-bye*
in the tips if his wings)
Ecstasy overwhelms, as she prep-airs to be free,
My world, my beautiful world . . .
My emotions were never something,
My mind?

Quietly whispered
that would work to take your life
Because my soul I did sell.
I still have callouses
Set it down on the floor
Who would have thought
What you were up to.
Im sorry,
The memory joins me in my misery

i'm scared to admit it
Sit down at the table with a tablet and pen
Only you can piece me back together again
She's the girl
We are slaves to some weird creatures dream, I life no longer is reality,
And as the bullet shells hit the floor
I remember what you said
I am just a shadow,

That trickled down for hours
you were with a male
he jumped in front of a subway train...
Not here

that I am once again alone
Doesn't mean I am.
and signed it with a knife
Material things jump out at me
Her heart was waiting
Your choosing not to stay with me

His Words she can't Erase
We can't go back and change what's happened,
hang with my angels?
Full of hesitations
In math,
Sometimes I see the moon
She can change everything
But I guess in real life

YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME
No, it's funnier with the monkies on the ceiling.
But you left me here to watch the love die
why he loves me so much.
As I wonder, wonder
Me?

is now as real as my dream
more vivid
Love Has Spoken
daddy dosent care
This prevented her from showing her true feelings.
and when I can't show it to you,
hallmark's biggest holiday

I loved him when we were together,
i will fight the emptiness
This will never be, so
Hazing is gone

Without me
Please once more
Never meant, wanting to go insane.
I hold onto my pillows ever so tight.
Oh god, let me fall, be your fallen angel
i'm just another lonely face,
we are friends meant to be

Turn away
I talked to you
reminds me of the tears streaming down my face
"If you make that face
now I’m back have you changed your mind
The cool metal resting underneth to provide support,
Well, only a stranger
but that will never come true you
A longing for the angels touch consumes me

time can be stopped by the lock.
I will not forget any of you in my dark days
How?
Past my conscious sense and reason
I find myself crumbling, doing always as i am told.
But still I am not cold
Im finding myself curled into a ball
This is me

then later on that next year.....
When I get a text message from you,
Why is the world of here so cold
I couldn't take meaning when
and the quiet pounding as my heart dies.
of the point on my skin.
We rise up today

and I turned and ran
And thunder will scream my name.
I'll be a good girl
Everyday she's tortured

The one of the future?
Hand me your consideration
I surrender to you night sky
As was taken under,
Saying my final good-bye to the world because no one came to my aid.
I wanted to make it all better...
I’m so tired of everything I do wrong
and on and on
† † † † † † † † † † † † † † † Laughter streaming like an unfrozen river.

We can't go back and change what's happened,
Don’t leave me as you have before.
Is ther something missing, missing from my soul,
But I can't seem to stop.
I cry again this time,
She kisses your gentle, sweet lips
And then one night
why don't you trust me?
She feels the wind rushing to greet her

More tears,
that you would stay.
I want every one to know we will always love you, Brandy
I call to all
For I feel it not,
I carved your name across my heart.
She was this beautiful girl,
You know you always
I could
I can't stop when world is spinning

>>>
I’m tired of ruining your life
I waited a few seconds
I speak perfect french
You've made a million mistakes
Are my hidden dreams, buried stealthily in denial about to come true?
What follows will never satisfy.
they say its only a check up
To look rather than merely see

The Pain and tears
Why Did I Sell Me Out?
What would happen if I died
Who I really am inside
I'm still glad your like my mother
I'm trying
That I was in big trouble

Raw and exposed to pain and hate
[Emitting a sweet, cherubic sense of grace]
I wish life wasn't as hard as it looks on TV
then if this place is so perfect
Chapstick and homesick
I’m the disease

It's really nothing new.
Judgement
Force full lonely stranger,
That's how life goes sometimes

Bleeding through the sane...
To make it through
Now today I have been betrayed a second time.
I pack my broken dreams
i will always

And everyone will know
I did not smile,although I wanted to
please just ask and you shall receive
As I jumped and banged my head
Open my eyes to see
and I didn't see the pain or the regret
You portray my every fear

what am i?
You're pretty when you're mad
If I cried would you stay?
We shall take our leave
Becuase I know they're all lies, I know how it starts.
You can push me away
Why are you so damnedably nice?
I left myself vulnerable for
CURSED EGO NEVER SEEMS TO DIE OFF FAST
Why I cant seem to find

like "i am broken when i'm lonesome"
Exposing your veins through thin cellulose
Hold not for him utter contempt
While Keats and Lord Byron
Nothing More Then This.
and the vodka and methol too
I cried so hard, when I left,
Senses of regretment filling into my veins, as I drink the blood I once bled,
Your words soothe my soul and

i can feel the blood beging to drip
the belief in the power of two
in search of you baby pleas tell me what to do
leaving your self to drown alive
My heart is yours
you gave me a reason to live.
Why is this happening to me?
cardboard table

to what you
Slip as the clock catches time
that this would be the end
How long do I have to dodge your glances?
im too scared
Put out by my tears
But with another man,
Keep it, you can have

say my name one more time and i need to hear your voice
On that fine summer day, when the light was dim,
† † † † † † † † † †Lost in Kisses,
I left another message, and,

Before I Die
I've paid a terrible price for my ignorance
Why won't the darkness let me be
I've done every drug
See its true-

But there is nothing that I could do.
When I looks to the mirror,
Without you I'm frightened at the possibility of no cope
In the eyes of blind I won’t be the one looking back.
Unopened Letter to the world by the ataris
What did I do to deserve this?
most of the time i like who i am

Time being her worst enemy
what being alone is
Lips drawn back, fangs are bared,
And you fall to you knees
I didn't see us drifting apart.
but I think I love you too much.
Astounding,
Hardened shell of personal struggles
Hey
I hope you will always be there for me

If you hugged me I would hold you forever.
He sat across from me
For mom and I to leave
Life has found
and death would be too easy

I travel down the crooked country road of life on a daily basis
Come back to my arms
But not by definition
Now I really regret what i said
And although I'll always be with her and you..she needs somebody to come to.
And you hear the lies.
And secret frights.
You'll never forget, It's just one of those things.
And make sure you knew my love

I think about you constantly
The worst is over now
tears without knowing flow like streams down my face
why would I think this,
† † † † † † † † † † Shaded skyes,
Or the crushing of my soul?
The girl that noone notices

she's the one sitting 2 rows over in geometry
can go to heII
I will always heart you
Yet no answers arise

Sinking in the hole Ive dug,
In their first kiss.
i want to let her know that im here for her
UNTO YOU I WRITE THIS!
But every time I try you shut me out
to help me know I'm not insane

And I'm filling my veins,
What I'm going to do now
Plastic melts under heat, so will you, you stupid
Comatose,
† † † † †And hugged her,
Yet in all honesty

My smile fades away.
but im left with nothing
i can fly away with you in my heart
I'm not the little girl you want me to be?

liars speak truth
Inhale my destiny with the nicotine
And wait
Kill us like a new disease
i didn't move nor did i cry
to me to you
Is true love consuming??
Don’t you remember
I love ya more than you'll know

now that i have wings
Time for goodbyes,
I want you to be my one and only
seeming invisible
Continue nourishing me with your adoration.
i float above the clouds

I am alone.
you can be human too..."
All those times we fought
If she should die...

with out knowing how long we've been dead
That will treat me right
The time it takes you
Last night in my living room,
is blue
Is so surreal
The sun is destined to explode
Asphault be thine name,

† † † † † † † † † †Because letters cant talk.
And lay out and stare into eachothers eyes promising to stay forever.
The way you look at me,
† † † †She found her 'Clique'
† † † † † † † † † † † †Nothing again.

This is your fourth Christmas
My dreams
And don't believe for one second
Tonight is all we need
You kept me holding on for so long
In this waltz
Your rules are ridiculous
It's a weak crescent shape
Lala started this group

But I wont cry
I now possess broken bones.
never uttered from my lips
I felt right at home
of what little control I had
That you leaned in and kissed me

To be complete within you.
Just looks into the distance
All this sadness just adds up to the rest of my madness
It may not seem so bad
and it can still be
and my vision adjusts to the sunlight.
Never got to tell you
But then I closed my eyes and you were here

Now it's filled with your heart, and a realization that you're finally mine.
Look me in the eyes and listen to what I have to say,
And right before your very eyes, you just watched me fall.
A violent shade of inconvenience
on the floor
But when I get onstage at night

To hold steadfast,
I'm a selfish bitch.
And it's called "Looking me in the eyes!"
Take up your newborn heart,
Too afraid to open your eyes and see
They were just words in your ear.
some things will never change
You would want me to go on,

I'd cut myself open again
I tell myself that I can't quite decide what it is.
always being who they want me 2 be
When you said;
When I was blind, you helped me see,
have I felt close to you.

Baby that was lust.
Like I love you,
Cause all that I now stand for can't handle this
I can't hear him through this chaos
Memories will ease the pain

Be everything I see.
They were just so beautiful,
The time it takes you
Go back to sleep
This is me
When all they do is judge your life
Remember I Love You,

But no matter how much I’d beg you to say
She wore her long white Nightie,
We Wisper Our "I love you's"
made sure all doors were locked
and i love it better when you scream "i love you "
you leave me hanging like that

Tonight's the night when nothing is as it was.
to cast its light upon it
My angels are always there
she knew she was alone in the world
in my life
I'll search the whole damn world
but you made me
Now that I'm gone.
Your death destroyed me
Are something i'll never forget

the other is cautious, withdrawn, and sometimes full of fear
Are some dreams best left in silence?
You spoke immortal words,
I am lost in my own feelings
^^^that is nothing....
You're just too warm
to stay here one more day
I am angry
Deny it all you want

you closed your eyes as did i
And hides so well,
When you outgrow this
To remember the good
It's happened babe
A-Okay!
Underneath your placid skin,

and feel the need to slap you and scream
but when your in my situation you do what you do
But trust me
I shouldn’t, they didn’t even call
Tell me two wrongs don't make a right
Why not live in the now?
because everything was changed.
Myths were being generated

While the blood
No light to surpass my way
more inspiring
It has all been thrown at me
I'm never right,
Like I don't know what to do
but I meant nothing to you.
It's almost like Im lost
Nine months a waste of my life

It's all in my mind. It's all in my Mind
I guess it built my character.
And if you dont believe me
Hear your children
Taking the last steps to collect my mind.
Think what it is,
For me to really grasp

there were drugs, and i new there would be trouble.
Tried to predict the future, see what lies ahead
I'm going to stop crying now.
And carve. Carve

from where I am
When you are never there
to pass a little time
And you hardly seem to notice.
Can you help me?
And you fall to you knees
I'm ready to come home
you were supposed to read it
I love him ever so much....
Do you remember the first time I went to your house?

Do you ever wish you had me to hold?
I’ve always thought something like rain.
on the floor
You’re killing me slowly.
I only wish i could have made you stay,
You've suddenly stopped moving.
other that the way you avoided me
when you ran

you broke her heart
The first time that you said my name is when I fell for you
I HATE SO MUCH
P E N C I L
but all it seems to want to do is disappear and hide
They try to relieve their pain with a knife

But I will not wait for you until there is no more coffee in my cup.
In the shape of a girl.
And it's just you and me
That's a stupid reason.
These feathers do not flutter
Does anyone see that?
I wonder around

and now he's gone.
thou none where said
when the clock’s ticking is magnified
come when
Not the usual me wishing myself dead
The simplest truth has become the most profound
"I love you"
Will it not change.
It hurts to be around you

I've been doing it for too long
i can't help but to contemplate
we could make something to relieve the pain
but didn't care to think

But my heart is weakening from the wait
Every intimacy...
Through love cuts in her tears
hopeful and beautiful,
Staring into oblivion
you're in too deep
Your passion flaring, burning my sight
confused

That keeps me awake
And finally found the courage.
Bow at the alter
Lets point in her direction
In my dream world..
Behind close doors i kneel to
Now I'm picking up this mess
Yesterdays feelings are making me feel sad,
Or with a tear
You don't live my life,

Then you kissed me
Make me see what you see
He just wanted to do the right thing,
Watch me as I sigh
And encapsulate the heart

Where did I go wrong
so I'll leave you alone
Every time your in my presence
Stop tearing me apart

the screen
You gave them to me
theres no feeling like this
i pray wishing,
[To prove I'm sorry]
I Don't Want Your Faith
And I'm just trying so hard to be something
No..

so I gave you the key
all you're bitching and lying
There was evil in this guy
Frozen ice
ive cut my sorrow
What the hell is wrong with me, I'm not normal like you,

Trying to figure out what's wrong
But we just stand here
we collide...
And I can't even sleep
All over again

The paladin is not here,
Please don't break my heart
My immagination...
†You're just another pretty Face darling.
your not perfect
End of Author Entry
I need your touch, the closest embrace

Looking with both eyes to a sky who won't
they stain in a red....
And we call it "emo", to fabricate a luke-warm compassion to sadness
As I stumble to the bathroom,
Words bonding them together through each endeavor

the truth is closing in
Could you...
of warm fertile earth.
I wait for you until there is no more coffee in my cup.

Kiss the stars good night
Cover up our old mistakes
I will always find you!!
It's time to steal my soul back.
A racial slur left on a car

you grab my arm
F-I-N-E is what im becoming.
Forgive me for how I made you bleed
I wanted your love
I will find myself
when everyone else said freak.

Just see me
For someone to share
Was the day
Wish that someone was here to help me.
My life is transient and I'm full of rage
Now what is real
I believe in love at first sight
I don't think that "God" would talk to them and no one else.

Tear me apart from the inside out
You will always be my beloved Father
It's proven every day.
Going to a pile of dust
A heart that speaks in beats
i fight those feelings every day

Carried on bitterness
In ma head.
Picked last out of all of your friends,
...shes laughing at you and pinching skin ...
They acted like they wanted my life,
† † † † † † † † † and is a Lona in her classes
Dare I speak up?
and jocks
just knowing youll be standing
ANY OTHER

Until our world burns down
If you do, it'll mean more than
All this angst built up inside me, Just waiting to all come out
I laugh to myself as your evil digs deeper.
From every cut.

(I told her, don't let the pieces die)
I can still remember
You never said a thing and still I cried
All my hate that seems to follow
Boots he gets about
why did you choose me for cupids dart?
but only when she was alone.
So you'll just continue to tour
This life is shit
And you got me wanting you

when i knew it was you,
Just To Be Near YouÖ.
my life indeed is over.
What lies

Hold my hand, never let go
saying "is it getting cold in here?"
and throw it away
Through love cuts in her tears
it's the whole world.

always brought a smile upon my face
These wounds you dug,
dead as a nail.
I have a gun
Who would have thought
>>>

Means nothing...
When I am said and done
And the fields of diamonds
Before now I never wants
In fear of damnation.
And sat round the fire telling stories,
no to end hope,
I know that I cant bring you back

I try not to like you, but it's something I can't control.
any mistakes
i saw squirrels
because your silence
But me!
Linnon am meleth vÓn!
I miss the sharp scent of roses

Myself great pain!
The feelings I have for him are much more than last time
And ever so gentle
Too far up to see the clouds
I go weak when
Pretending to be having a good time
and sweet
grand. †But there will be a villein left in the end.
How can I?

He had the key
tame the beast...
i wanna do anything
It was never like I cared.
(Would You even realize I'm gone)
then youll drift of into the night!
He held my hand
I can't meet your demands. I want you to leave.

A tender kiss of velvet, with the sweetest of all tastes.
I hope this fun never ends
please stop
I’M NOT SORRY FOR HURTING YOU
You left me here, You broke my heart...
they found him by the whisky bottle

the rose you left to die
While dreaming a dream
Stop being so bitchy
Even if I try I cannot remember the present me
But it's just too hard to hold on
it could be legendary
I heard it too...
Were Not In Vain...

I see the Devils grasp on you
Together forever isn’t a myth, because...
Gathering all these memories I wish to never have.
I'm breaking down
She told me "everything is great"
she faced it on her own,
A razor.
Seems so distant.

She's a substitute for me
Dot the O's
I'm paying that now...my pillow is soaked from tears...
She will come back to me
I wish he was in my arms,
But as time goes by
the way i had sleepless nights over you
I cried so hard, when I left,
Don't let it break ya down

Can barely grasp the soaking dream
You can't keep us down any longer
I kissed you
I don't know what I'm doing
You’re near
Reaching For The Top...
†But as i dusted this C.D off,
with her I wish you'd stop.
Flesh Burns, Deaths Decay
