"4Title: Alcohol by ArcticIllusion at All poetry
"
"	<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"ÆMy name is Samara Rayne. I was born in Brooklyn, New York. I've been a hopeless drug addict and alcoholic for quite some time now. My mother died before I could generate lasting memories and my dad just didn't care. He was exactly like his dad was, an alcoholic, and I think that's been passed down through the generations to me. As far back as I can remember, there was something inherently wrong with the way I felt about myself. I was a really awkward kid, I used movies, played make-believe, had an imaginary friend to get away. I know that sounds like normal stuff for kids to do but it was why I used those things that makes me look back now and realize that all I wanted was an escape from reality.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"³My sister used to watch MTV a lot when I was younger. I started paying attention to it right around the time Nirvana was played about 100 times a day. There was something so </p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"xattractive about the way they were singing and playing that instantly, I realized I had found the escape I had been looking for in music. I was about 10 when I got my first Walkman and every week I would use money I earned to buy more tapes. Grunge was pretty huge then, so I had Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Joy Division and my some old Beatles tapes I found.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
" I couldn't get enough.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"êI went into 6th grade the next month and all I wanted was to be in a band. Fuck math, fuck gym, fuck history; fuck everything except for music and fuck everyone except those who played it. I met this kid who was into music I had never heard before. He said it was called punk: Misfits, Green Day, Offspring, Sex Pistols, Bad Religion.it was like I was falling in love all over again. That was &quot;The year that punk broke&quot;. Which is also the year I discovered alcohol and drugs.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"The first time I got drunk was in a park with my friend and his brother. I drank half a 40 of Bull Ice, I was so drunk I couldn't even walk home, they had to carry me. They left me on my front lawn, where at 5:30am my dad found me lying in a pool of my own vomit. I swore to him that I was just sick and needed to go to bed. I'm pretty sure he knew what happened and thought I learned my lesson.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"rAs I said before, I had always felt like there wasn't something quite right inside me, but when I took a drink I felt normal for the first time. I never wanted to feel the way I felt when I was sober again. so I started drinking everyday. My friends and I would ditch school, go steal some beer and drink it at the park. We thought nothing could stop us. We were indestructible. The same friend that got me into punk also introduced me to weed, and we smoked it constantly. By the end of 6th grade I was so excited about this new life that everything else fell by the wayside, then I was kicked out of school that spring.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"4At the start of 7th grade I was back at the same school, doing the same shit: skipping, stealing, telling teachers and principle to go fuck themselves. One month led into the school year and they expelled me from the district for good. Which was fine by me gave me more time to write songs and do drugs.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"óAt this point getting high and music has taken over my life completely. One of my best friends at the time had decided she had enough and one afternoon she wrote a note, took her dad's 9mm and shot herself. Had I not done drugs I wouldn't have made it through that. On my 14th birthday I was a full on heroin, coke and speed junkie. I snorted anything anyone had; will it break down with water or heat? Yeah I did that to. Anything to keep me in away from reality. My friends and I got into crime to support our growing habits, stealing cars, shoplifting tools and returning them for cash, robbing houses, robbing people. Nothing was sacred any more; we had to do everything we could to feed our addictions. I overdosed a number of times, watched friends overdose and die right in front of me, but I couldn't help them because I was too fucked up. I was living on the street, in abandoned houses, or with friends. I had several run-ins with cops and went to jail more times then I can remember. Still even through all of this, the jail time, the treatment centers, losing people I loved, not having a place to go. There was always something constant in my life and it was music. It was always there the pick me up or make me feel that I wasn't alone in all this.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"ÏI've been fighting these addictions now my entire life, and just recently I have been able to stay sober for longer then a month. So far I have been sober for over 3 months and it’s far from being easy.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"Getting clean is different for everyone I guess, for me it took a huge loss of heartache. I had to be a bottom of the barrel junkie. I had to lose everything to wake up; the one constant through the dark and this light was music. It has never let me down.</p>
"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>
"I'll admit it; I'm fucking scared to death of who I was and who I become if I drink. I'm scared all the time because it’s just one fuck up away. One choice and everything I've worked on for the past many months will be gone.

"	<br />
"­Today’s children should be taught to live in the moment. Instead, they are trained to want success and happy endings. It becomes so easy to forget to enjoy the ride. <br />
"<br />
"âMe, I’ve always been a beginner. I live for the start of new seasons and I thrive in the midst of fresh starts. I hate endings – their finality is deadly – hallmarks of forgotten memories, expired loves, lost feelings. <br />
"<br />
"S“But you can’t live your life in fear,” he said to me the other night. <br />
"<br />
"‰“I’m not,” I replied defensively. “I’m only being cautious. I’ve learned this the hard way. I just don’t want to get hurt again.” <br />
"<br />
""He stared back at me. <br />
"<br />
"ç“You know what your problem is?” he asked softly. “You overthink everything. You can’t control the world, sweetheart, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes you’ve gotta throw caution to the wind, live without looking back.” <br />
"<br />
"¶“That’s what scares me,” I whispered through the beginnings of tears. “I’m afraid that when we’re over, you’ll never look back. I can’t stand the thought of being forgotten.” <br />
"<br />
"@He took my hand and looked me straight in the eyes. <br />
"<br />
"c“We haven’t even had the chance to begin yet. Why are you already writing our ending?" <br />
"<br />
"–It made sense. I’d never thought about it before, but my tendency at the beginning of anything is to first look to the ending. But why? I swear, someone should have taught me sooner to be happy with what I have. To live for the sake of being alive. Maybe if they’d instilled in me from the start a sense of satisfaction, instead of always pushing me to do better, to aim higher, to gain more – maybe I could live with contentment. Maybe I could live without doubt, and insecurity, and fear. Oh, if only they had taught me to believe… I could be like him, a dreamer, living without looking back. And more importantly, without always having to look forward.<br />

"6Title: Temporary by BestDeceptions at All poetry
"
"0	Billy tells me this is only temporary; he says it won’t be long before we’re together again. &nbsp;I don’t know if I believe him or not, but whenever I tell him that, Billy gets a strain in his voice and he gets mad that I’m doubting him. &nbsp;Whenever I cry, I can tell that it scares him, and he gets real serious and he shuts everything else out and concentrates on trying to make me stop, and this is what makes me think that maybe, maybe, just maybe he really does love me the way he says he does. &nbsp;But then the next day, Billy doesn’t call.<br />
"<br />
"÷The problem is that he still wants to act like everything’s the same, and I just can’t get over the fact that it’s not. &nbsp;He says he still loves me, that I should know how much he cares about me, that he still wants us to be together, and that why would I think this has something to do with some other girl? &nbsp;He’s with ME. &nbsp;But that’s the problem, he’s not with me anymore, and it was all his own choice. &nbsp;Billy broke up with me, it was five days after our anniversary. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"ÿHe says it’s because of his parents. &nbsp;Billy says that he’s just going through a lot of personal stuff right now, and that he just needs some time to deal with things on his own. &nbsp;He says that if we’re together right now, his parents will hate me, because somehow I’ll get involved in the argument. &nbsp;Billy doesn’t want his parents to hate me, so that’s why now we’re just friends. &nbsp;I say that I can’t see why it matters whether or not his parents like me, if we’re not together anyhow.<br />
"<br />
"
I tell him that I just don’t understand it; he says he’s already explained it the best he can. &nbsp;I say I just need to talk to him about it, I have questions, and I just need him to try to answer them the best he can. &nbsp;He says okay, but then we never do and whenever we start to, just when we’re finally starting to get somewhere, we get interrupted and we can’t finish it. &nbsp;I tell Billy that he’s just not the same anymore, that he’s different now, it feels like he doesn’t want to talk to me, and like he’s trying to avoid seeing me. &nbsp;He says he feels like I don’t want to talk to him anymore, because whenever we’re on the phone, I don’t have anything to say. &nbsp;I say that’s not it, it’s just that I can’t tell anymore how he really feels. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"`I tell Billy that I used to think I had him figured out, but that I sure can’t tell anything anymore. &nbsp;Billy laughs; he says that’s real cute that I ever thought I had him figured out. &nbsp;I like it when Billy tells me that I’m cute, or when he calls me by one of his pet names, or uses one of our inside jokes. &nbsp;The other night we were on the phone, and he got real quiet and all he said was “You’re ridiculous, kid,” and I could hear everything he was feeling in his voice, I could feel his eyes closing shut, and I could feel his breathing getting shorter. &nbsp;See, that’s what Billy used to tell me when we’d kiss. &nbsp;We’d be in the backseat of his car, having one of our ‘conversations,’ and after a few minutes, he’d pull me close and close his eyes and just sigh. &nbsp;“You’re ridiculous, kid.” &nbsp;And then he’d kiss my forehead.<br />
"<br />
"2I miss the nights like those with Billy, and I try to tell him that. &nbsp;It’s the times like those that make me think Billy really does love me. &nbsp;I tell Billy that I don’t want to be his friend. &nbsp;He pretends to get offended, and says “well, fine.” &nbsp;But I’m real strong, and I don’t let his feelings get to me. &nbsp;I just keep a straight face and I say “You know what I mean,” and I don’t let anybody crack me. &nbsp;Billy knows exactly why I don’t want to be his friend. &nbsp;He knows I want to be much, much more than just his friend.<br />
"<br />
"-And last night, Billy told me that he doesn’t want to just be my “friend.” &nbsp;He tells me that this won’t be long, that this is only temporary. &nbsp;He says it doesn’t have anything to do with any other girl, but I still don’t know if I believe him. &nbsp;But then again, I can’t blame him because I flirt, too. &nbsp;That’s how me and Billy met, we’re both big flirts and we flirted together. &nbsp;Lots. &nbsp;I used to think I’d never forgive any man for thinking about any other girl but me, that if he so much as looked at another girl, I’d leave him. &nbsp;After all, if he was with me, I should be the only girl he needs or wants to talk about and think about. &nbsp;But now, I’m not so sure, because Billy has pictures of calendar girls in his room, and there are girls at work that flirt with Billy all the time, even though they know about me. &nbsp;And it bothers me, and it hurts, and I hate to have to watch it, but then again, at the end of the day, Billy IS with me. &nbsp;I mean, that’s gotta stand for something. &nbsp;It just has to. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"¿I don’t know where me and Billy are going next, and I don’t know where we’ll end up, because I can hardly even remember where we’ve been. &nbsp;I don’t know if I care either, so long as we end up somewhere together. &nbsp;I’m still so scared to trust Billy, and I just don’t know if I should let it out or not. &nbsp;But even through all of this, I know I still love him, because I just can’t get him off my mind. &nbsp;I feel safe with him, even when I’m scared, just like I am now. &nbsp;But right now I gotta go. &nbsp;Because I’ve been trying to get a hold of him all night, after all the crying I did on the phone with him last night, I just need to talk so bad. &nbsp;And Billy just called.<br />

"¥	I sat at the computer, looking down at my phone. &nbsp;I had a message, from whom? &nbsp;It was 9:30 in the morning and I knew that people were still asleep.<br />
"<br />
"ìI reached for it, punching in the numbers, “1-2-3”. &nbsp;Soon my voice mail came on the line. &nbsp;Kris called twice that night. &nbsp;He called around four in the morning and at five. &nbsp;He called to tell me goodbye. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"êI listened to the message, my ear glued to the phone. &nbsp;The rest of the world did not matter to me. &nbsp;Nothing registered but the fact that he was taking his life and he was leaving me. &nbsp;He was leaving me all alone.<br />
"<br />
""Kris put back the pieces of my heart and helped heal my soul. &nbsp;Now, in the blink of an eye, he tore my world in two. &nbsp;I died a little bit that day. &nbsp;A part of me was ripped from my soul, from my heart. &nbsp;The void he filled was once again open but deeper this time.<br />
"<br />
"}I sat the phone down gently on the desk, my other hand covering my mouth. &nbsp;Tears fell from my eyes as water falls down a waterfall. &nbsp;They streamed down my face fast and heavy, not stopping. &nbsp;I had to gain my composure. &nbsp;I could not let my mother see. &nbsp;I had to hide my tears, my pain. &nbsp;I did not want my mother mocking him even in death. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"¥My chest hurt so bad, I thought I was going to faint or die myself. &nbsp;I listened to the message again. &nbsp;I thought, hoped that maybe I was wrong. &nbsp;That I heard it all, imagined it. &nbsp;But alas, it did happen, I did hear it. &nbsp;I stumbled to the bathroom across the hall; my family did not even see me leave my room. &nbsp;Too wrapped up in their own lives, they never even notice my pain. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"ªHe mentioned that it might not work, that he might not die. &nbsp;I clung to that hope, even if it were false hope. &nbsp;It was the only thing keeping me from collapsing. &nbsp;I wanted to call his house, to ask his family. &nbsp;I knew they would not call me back his parents hated me. &nbsp;His mother hated me and blamed me for his problems. &nbsp;I was scared for it to be true; I never picked up the phone. &nbsp;<br />
"<br />
"ÅI would die for him, yet he could not live for me. &nbsp;Somewhere in my heart I know he is gone. &nbsp;He attempted to kill himself in October; I just prolonged the effect. &nbsp;I knew things were not going well, I knew. &nbsp;I knew he was hurting and I did nothing. &nbsp;Just words came from my mouth over the phone or were typed onto the computer. &nbsp;What if I stayed on the phone longer? &nbsp;So many questions race through my mind as to what I could have done. &nbsp;I should have been able to save him. &nbsp;What if I left my phone on, then I would have heard the ring and wake up. &nbsp;If not to talk him out of committing suicide, at least…at least to say, “Goodbye. &nbsp;I love you.”<br />
"<br />
"%I listen to the messages again; possibly there was something in the message, telling me he was not dead. &nbsp;Nothing, but later I found his goodbye poem. &nbsp;I did not even get to tell him goodbye, one last time. &nbsp;No more “I love you’s” or battle of who loves each other more. <br />
"<br />

":Title: Rights for ALL!! by Cadee Blaze at All poetry
"
"ù	They live among us, work in the same jobs, and have friends and family just like the rest of society. &nbsp;There is just one little difference that tends to bother people. &nbsp;These people are still different; they are homosexuals. &nbsp;<br />
"mReligion states that they are sinful and do not deserve the rights such as heterosexuals, but in today’s society who is not sinful? &nbsp;People are experiencing intercourse before they are married; adultery is committed yet no one thinks anything of it. &nbsp;The Bible even states that getting a tattoo is sinful. &nbsp;How many people have tattoos? &nbsp;<br />
"%	Just recently have things begun to change but part of that is due to the War on Terrorism. &nbsp;Under the Presidency of Bill Clinton the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy was put in place, so gays and lesbians could fight for the county they love just as heterosexuals are aloud to. &nbsp;<br />
"	The military and armed forces are the leading employer for the United States. &nbsp;They set an example for the rest of the businesses, if the military will not higher people based on who they take to bed then why would other businesses have to. &nbsp;These people wish to sever their country; they are citizens just like everyone else. &nbsp;What happened to civil liberties? <br />
"	What I don’t get is why people are so afraid of them? &nbsp;Or wish to kill them? &nbsp;They bleed just like other people do, laugh and cry just like other people do but they have a different sexual orientation so there must be something wrong. &nbsp;Other countries allow homosexuals in the military, such as England and Canada. &nbsp;Most countries even have rights to protect homosexuals. &nbsp;The U.S. News wrote an article about rights for gays in Canada and in Ireland. &nbsp;Why hasn’t the United States done anything about it?<br />
"G	Isn’t the United States based on freedoms and rights for all? &nbsp;So why are homosexuals so different? &nbsp;Gays and Lesbians are not mutated humans, aliens, or mental patients, yet our country and most of the citizens treat them no better. &nbsp;Is it because people always seem to fear what they do not understand?<br />
"	"When I was in the military they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one." This was taken from the tombstone of a gay Vietnam veteran. &nbsp;People are comfortable with killing but not when a man loves a man or when a woman loves another woman. &nbsp;<br />
"Þ	If the only reason for people disliking homosexuals is religion then we should go back to the old ways. &nbsp;Meaning, women who cheat on their partner must be stoned and children must be beaten as their punishment. &nbsp;Other things have progressed over time and I hope that the rights for homosexuals will improve as well. &nbsp;I just want to know when the hate and witch hunts will end. &nbsp;Maybe my children and their children will be safe from bigotry and hate.<br />

Frank offered Billy some acid. Billy said, “eih, Iss druk so I do.” Billy did the acid. Billy felt no different. 5 minutes went by, and Billy started feeling strange. The walls began to bleed around him, and he felt as if he was in a tornado that was not moving. He looked up to the ceiling, and it wasn’t there. All he saw was clouds and thunder. Fish began to swim around the room. The clouds started forming into a big wind demon, and started trying to get him. So Billy stood up, and tried to run, but there was a current. He couldn’t run. He got scared. He ran to the corner of the room, and leaned against the wall. Blood started drip down off of him. He got so scared that he ran into the bathroom, it taking about 1 hour to go the next room. Then he sat in the corner and shook back and forth. Demons started coming out of the walls. Billy got so scared that he grabbed the pair of scissors from the counter, and stabbed himself in the chest. Billy died.

"?	My eyes open as the sun breaks through the window onto my face. As my eyes open, I remember what you said, and realize that the only bliss that I was feeling, was the beautiful dream that I was having. When I wake, all of the feelings of panic, hurt, depression, and fear, suddenly come rushing back to me and hit me like a load of bricks. I feel as if nothing matters anymore, and if I commit suicide at this exact moment, no one would care, or even notice that I was gone. Not even you. And you said that you loved me. You promised. But not everything that everyone says is exactly how they feel, even if that is what they thin that they feel at the time. How do you know that this is true? Have you even showed me? Have you even tried to be close to me? Those are my immediate thoughts as soon as I wake in the morning. <br />
"<br />
"ÅI stand up, and look at my face in the mirror. I hate what I see. I hate the way my hair flows across my face, down past my shoulders. I hate how my blue eyes begin to tear. I hate how I feel so low all of the time, and mostly because of you. I wonder if one day I will not feel this way anymore. Like all of this will just fade away, and I will be better again, with nothing to fear, and no reason to want to die every waking moment of my life. <br />
"<br />
"aWhen I finally put on my face, and realize that this is a new day, my eyes wont stop tearing. I hurt more and more, and I hate it. I think about you. I want to be with you every second of my life, but at the same time, I want you to die. I remember everything that you’ve done to me, and everything that everything that you said that hurt me. All of the abuse that you threw upon me, and how horrible you made me feel, by everything that you said, just killed me every time I thought about it. I want to forget about this, and just move on, but sometimes the pain gets too strong, and I can’t hold on to the thought of forgetting you. You meant more to me than anyone in my entire life, and I wish I didn’t feel this way about you still, after all of this time, and after everything that you did to me. You made me hate myself, because you loved me so much. <br />

".Title: Bad Taste by Elly A at All poetry
"
")	Dark hours of my misery return to run a lap with the minutes on the clock. I refuse to be a mannequin on display for you to fashion with abuse. Guilt has never been my favorite accessory and my sensitivity can't stand the chipped crystals embedded by my cries. I'm full of reasons to despise your name, yet I long for your change and most of all your happiness. When the time comes and you cross into another state of being, I pray you find the glory you so much want. Hell is what you've been living, and in your eyes I was only an addition to that turmoil. Tell anyone who approaches you that your bitter scent is the perfume of my memory. I won't defend myself, your anger is stronger than this hand of mine reaching out to help you. So place the blame on me, paint my pain with the color of your choice and cover your back with it. Let my suffering be the blanket you hide under and my tears be the warmth you bathe in. Continue lingering in our miscommunication while I smile here and think of why I loved you in the first place. Nothing can change that you were the soul with the laughter and hope that pushed me to that so called stage of happiness when nobody else was there. You can't help how you feel and there's nothing I can do to keep from being the bad taste left in the mouth of where your emotions mix.

"9Neglects the wilting rose of love and comfort<br />

"«	Quick to defend that of which is yours, don't you see that words do not have to be spoken to be felt? They don't have to speak aloud and say what they really think it can be heard miles away through simple small actions. Whether spoken or felt don't you see that the pain remains the same? You which have not been judged do not know the feeling but those who have know my heartache. If setting your own beliefs, following and standing up for them is wrong then label me a bad influence. If my actions don't fall in that of which is "normal" be it my cutting, my anxiety, my insomniatic moments..then label me a freak. If sharing my feelings open and honest beyond that of which you dislike, I do not apologize for the way I am but I apologize for the offense to your close minded character. Do not tell me i am not being judged when the feeling is so much there for if you do not want me to feel that way let your actions show otherwise.

Sleep to others such a simple task to me the most difficult...I live in an opposite world I sleep by day and live by night. I become so in tune with myself listening to the beating of my heart...the thoughts and memories swirling my mind the trembling of my hands as my anxiety slowly sets in. My salvation is getting too tired to stand straight I tire myself out at night to the point where I have no choice but to throw myself on the bed and sleep.

I question if others can see the amount of pain hidden behind my eyes, or is it invisible to those I trust? Questions questions...Why? What am I living for? What must I learn? What lesson is God teaching me? So many goals but which one must I accomplish?....Time is against me, but I will strive to win.

"3Title: Sex? by HopelessRomantic at All poetry
"
"{	what is so wrong with sex? why is it frowned upon in our society? what is so wrong with pre-marital sex? i talked to my ex last night...we're talking about getting back together. we dated for a year and a half...the whole time talking about going all the way...giving each other our virginity...it never happened. then when we're talking about getting back together...when im hitting on her, she comes out and says that she's waiting for marriage. i felt betrayed...i felt lied to...but why? theres nothing wrong with wanting to wait until marriage. what is sex after all? surely its nothing more than a mating process thats been around since mammals evolved (or were created...depending on your beliefs). why did i feel so horrible when she told me she was waiting? why did she decide to wait? there are so many unanswered questions about the topic. ive thought for a long time that its something you do with someone when you love them enough...but lately ive been wondering. maybe its a drive given to us by hormones...the hormone that influences the want to reproduce. maybe its not about fun at all...ive always had a feeling that human beings are nothing more than poorly tended machines...and this may just be how we're programed. i cant say for sure...but sex seems like an awfully touchy subject to be looked upon so simply like most people do (IE its something special thats for that one person...or its just a fun thing to do with another person). i dont believe that its so simple...but ive never thought about it enough to be conclusive. maybe this deserves a few hours of solid thinking...and i'll continue this when i've done said thinking...

"	Your staring at the mirror thinking back on your thoughts, remebering the times you held his hand, What can you think when you finally realzie that his holding hand was only going to lead you to be falling down because he never was really there to catch you like a falling star like he said he would. Will your star drown in the tears that you created soaking up patheticness like the lonley self he created you to be because he cheated and lied, never telling anything of real fiction. What has this world come to? Creating lies, making people believe are true, the only thing you can do now, is sit back and watch the times roll by, until Mr.Perfect comes along to carry you away on his magistical pony, carrying you to the palace temple of your dreams to live in happiness forever....<br />

"PTitle: Sophisiticated Thoughts Of Thirteen by I am hollywood at All poetry
"
"_	Depressing thoughts come forth out of my mind, acting more sophisticated than my teen age. Who ever knew I could think so much about my future, and hating every minute I dream. I see a road of failure, a blank road of disgrace, no love, no hope, no purpose, just a waste. Time goes by, no sleep for me, I keep on dreaming the nightmare I will lead. I try to cry, but no tears come out, I used them all up, about two years ago. I'm only thirteen, how could I hate so much, I hav't even seen the beginning of my life, yet I predict so soon. I wish I never thought, I wish I never dreamt, I wish I was not so different, I wish I had a life that was meant. Everything I ever try just turns into the ashes of failure, my music, my work, my love, my everything. I wish for a hug, a pat on the back, something to show you care, because I already know you care so much, I just wish I could contain it more than I do. People call me a loser, just as a joke, I know it's all a joke every single day, but for some reason, looking back on it, it just makes me feel bad. Overweight I seem to be, I wish to be perfect and thin, acne scars cover my face, I wish I could erase, but no matter how much cover up I wear, they always seem to seep through. Beauty shouldn't matter, but for some reason it does, becuase I'm a failure at everything, that I try to hold something that I can do....

"Ü	Why cant they love in they way they wish too, their love is forbidden by the strife of their parents words, Their secretive kiss is an illegal case they must confide, while their vow of sharing words is only supposed to be of hate and angst. Their secretive romance only leads them to their death, only burying the anger they had to live thorugh. The heaven they are sent to is the only peacful place they can love and rejoice without the hate of the world below. So quietly before they did die, they made one peaceful kiss, lip to lip;palm to palm. With the angels surrouding them with passion, more then the world could contain. This love was too strong that no-one could see, They had to leave the world to be happy and free...

You all see me as a fake obscure doll with no feelings for anything. You see me as a fictious book of emotions, you think I am not real that I am a portrait of wanting attention. The image you see of me is the image of me you wish to dream, but this dream is not what I wish to see.

"X	So....currently, I am with Someone-Who-Loves-Me. (And I always will be...) <br />

"NI am...confused. I don't really know what I'm doing here, exactly.<br />
"tBy 'here' I don't mean...here where I am sitting, but...my purpose to be. My existence in its entirety. <br />
"eSee...if I was in Texas, with that Someone-Who-Loves-Me, maybe I wouldn't be so confused.<br />
"_Maybe, just maybe, I'd actually feel like I actually belong somewhere, to someone. <br />
"ðEven the mother of that Someone-Who-Loves-Me likes me more than my own other does, apparently. Mine isn't showing to have that much of a positive impact on my life. Which...if it was me...I wouldn't think it to be such a good thing. <br />
"cMy mother doesn't seem to care all that much; it doesn't really bother her at all. Meh.<br />
"„So...if anyone feels like they want to...pitch for me to go and live in Texas, just let me know. T'would be much appreciated.<br />
"‹It's weird, not that many people from Canada feel like the only place they might belong is in Texas...that's pretty much unheard of.<br />
"‹Ist of all, it's an American state...(no offence), and this is Canada. 2nd, ...it's Texas of all states(again, no offence intended).<br />
"íIt isn't necessarily me wanting to go to Texas for the sake of it being Texas, it's that that Someone-Who-Loves-Me-That-I-Can't-Live-Without just happens to live there. In another country. At the very bottom of that other country.<br />
"Convenient, no?<br />
"No.<br />
"Not at all.<br />
"2It makes my life a bloody living Hell.<br />

"tAnd he's so fucking far away...so far away, that he's in a different effing timezone. I'm an hour ahead.<br />

"&	What do I love about you?<br />
")Well, there are many things. <br />
"%I love the way you are...<br />
"%Meaning, the overall you.<br />
"6The way you talk, the sound of your voice.<br />
"¿How deep it is..and the way it goes deeper when you try to be serious [not that I don't take you seriously<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/tongue.gif" /> ], and the way it goes slightly higher when you know you're arguing a failing point and you know I'm right....or when I embarrass you, and you don't know what to say.[though...that really is quite cute of you.<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/roll.gif" /> ]<br />
"I love the way you're so pretty and handsome....with your pretty blue-ish green-ish eyes, and pretty pink lips...and the way you smile with them and though I don't see it...I can hear it...even though you don't think I can hear somebody smiling over the phone.<br />
"ZI love the way you beg for random things...even if there's nothing to beg for, and I remain totally clueless as to what you want. I love the way the word 'please' just rolls off your tongue in that one way that makes me melt and give in, then beg for you to stop begging for whatever it is you're begging for...even if it's nothing at all.<br />
"—I love the way you like provoking arguments just for the sake of arguing with me, and then remaining totally speechless most of the time when I 'win' the 'argument', because you know I'm right.[<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/happy.gif" /> ]...and because I flatter you too much and you don't know what to respond with.[<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/tongue.gif" /> ]<br />
"¤I love the way you contradict me whenever I say something bad about myself, then make me feel better and happier. And then I always manage to smile or laugh.<br />
"ÕI love the way that whenever I think about you, and the way you talk...a smile just seems to appear on my face and I start to daydream about you...and me with you...and everything about you and me with you.<br />
"%I love the way you always seem to say something that leaves me at a loss for words...or I stutter and my voice goes higher and funny, and you tell me to calm down when there was nothing to calm down for...I was just overrun by your charm, and nervous about making a fool out of myself. <br />
"¾I love the way you tell me that I don't need to be nervous, worried, shy, or that I don't need to say sorry when I'm talking to you, and then you ask me why I am, and I say 'I dunno'.<br />
"I love the way I ask you a question, and you answer my question with another question, leaving me speechless once again.<br />
"±I love the way we have so much in common, yet we can't really find anything to talk about...and then there's total silence, in which case you always say 'hello' to check if I'm still there, though I'd never leave you. [<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/happy.gif" /> ]...and that in turn makes me smile for some odd reason. I don't mind all the silence...I get to listen to you breathing when it's quiet. I'm sorry if that sounds creepy, but as I said, I love everything about you. Even your breathing. Your breathing and heartbeat are two things I'd like to listen to all the time...and two things that could put me to sleep with happy dreams, and a smile on my face.<br />
"»You're awesome, amazing...and virtually indescribable [in a good way<img src="http://img.allpoetry.com/images/smile/happy.gif" /> ], and not a thing in the world could change that.<br />

"ETitle: We are the Masquerade by IronyIsADeadScene at All poetry
"
"Ð		I could hardly see through the small holes in the mask. It was hot and I was sweating from all the dancing. She whirled and twirled around me. Our steps were perfect with the music. She had never looked so beautiful. She was the sparkle dancing on the ocean waves, rising and falling with the moonlight. I was below the water and all they could see what the surface. She was too perfect. They would never look past her. Diamond, they called to her. Her name could not live up to her; her delicate feet, her elegant vanity. She was a picture that framed my heart. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mozart was a genius, and he led me strait to her. Each note enticing her to step towards me. I was sure our worlds were about to collide. I braced myself for the impact, and embraced her for the control. It was so much better when she could not get away. It was right when I was the one who chose our fate. The music would have its way.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>The beats steadied themselves and I let her step around me. The clicking over her heals on the marble floor. The chandeliers all rivaled her, but could not compete. The rooms shone brighter in her presence than any time before.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>I could feel the fear mounting as the music faded. The crowd was closing in and she would be consumed. They were the mouth of the world’s desires. They would engulf her and steal her passion. So we fled. The starry night held us and the darkness stole us away. The rose in her hair was dying and the farther we became from the music the more she went with it. I held her tightly, thinking I could keep the life in her if I held her close enough. The sequins on her breathe were laced with resentment, and the crystals in her eyes were hiding. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>She gazed into my eyes and for a moment I was sure I would fall to pieces right in front of her. She raised her arm and gently stroked my cheek. I suspected foul play. And in an instant I regretted our dance. I could breathe again, but I hated her for it. My mask lay at my feet. I tore myself from her bitter embrace and fell to my knees in shame. I listened to her footsteps fade into the dark. <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>She discovered me, the only thing that would take her from me. I was the only thing that could drive her away. We were that dance. We were the moment under the stars. We were the shock of discovery. We were the shallow footsteps on the cobblestones. We were untouchable and unlovable all together. We were the masquerade. &nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>

"?Title: She Wasn't Okay by IronyIsADeadScene at All poetry
"
"Æ	It was stormy outside. Leeann was sprawled out on the floor of her room. Music pounded through her headphones. She didn't dare turn on her stereo; she didn't want to draw attention to herself. &nbsp;Locks of pale blonde hair were entwined in her fingers where she had torn it from her head when she was screaming. She hated screaming, but they had made her do it. They told her that she would feel better, they promised. Of course, they had lied.<br />
" <br />
""The rain poured down onto the window, and trickled down into the rain gutter. She had been listening to the same song for hours, locked away in hiding. Wasn't anyone missing her? The song assured her that she was forgotten. The one thing she had always feared. She could hear the yelling over the throbbing music. Turning the knob up a bit more she lost herself in the melodic singing, the voices just got louder and louder. Subconsciously she pleaded with them. They continued to remind her that she was never going to amount to anything.<br />
"<br />
"The pitch black was consuming her and she almost felt like she couldn’t breathe. The clock read 3:00 a.m. she couldn’t fall asleep, they wouldn’t let her. Insomnia was her only friend tonight. &nbsp;She hummed along to the music. Finally they rested for the night. She smiled and said goodnight. Perhaps, she would get to sleep tonight. They were rather tenacious and only slept on occasion. She had gone for five nights without sleep. She looked up at her bed and sighed. She hadn’t even sat there since the day they joined her. She thought they were just a phase from when she lost him. People didn’t talk to her much after the accident. She has always just thought that since no one would talk to her she had created them to keep her company. She knew that they didn’t love her and that it was their greatest pleasure to hear her scream. She didn’t mind though because at least they knew she was alive. Her friends and parents assumed she had killed him. They didn’t know her at all though. They didn’t know that she had loved him. She hated that she always thought about that day. She couldn’t blame them for thinking that she did it though. When she was found, she was holding him tight, pistol on the floor. Her hands, her face and her clothes were soaked in his blood. <br />
"<br />
"0They awoke the moment they knew she was thinking about him. Screaming at her, they told her that she was a failure. You could have done something; they said a sing-song voice. If you really loved him you wouldn’t have let him take the pistol to his head. She sat up abruptly. I tried to stop him, I told you that a million times. He wanted to do it, I couldn’t stop him. She brushed her hair back with her hand and screamed. The tears were coming and she was desperate to hold them back. Holding her hands over her ears she again opened her lips and a moan of agony escaped. Not knowing what else to do she allowed herself to scream, she screamed and screamed. They were laughing at her now. I thought you hated to scream? Don’t you feel better thought? Didn’t we tell you? &nbsp;They mocked her and laughed. <br />
"<br />
"ŒShe finally was able to close the gaping wound that was allowing the screams to leak away into the dark. To sew it shut she dug her teeth into her lip. The flesh cried strawberry wine that tasted like heartache. It dripped down onto her collarbone and soaked into her pale white shirt. His gold chain held tightly to her neck. She grabbed a hold of it. She knew it was thick and strong. The cold metal clutched in her hand she began to twist. The cool feel of it against her neck was almost the most pleasurable thing she had felt since she had felt his cool fingers push her hair back away from her neck. Tonight the chain was playing his part.<br />
" <br />
"ßShe twisted it tighter, the constriction around her throat made it almost impossible to even breathe. The rush felt good though. She had always thought she was particularly strong for not taking up drugs after the accident. Accident? They laughed. You know was no accident. You might as well just tighten that chain forever, you killed him. Another tear rolled down her cheek and she was finally sick of them. I didn’t kill him. I loved him. I just held his body when he was gone. I knew I couldn’t stop him so I told him I would take care of all that was left of the only thing I ever loved. The tears were coming faster and she tried to catch them in her hand so she wouldn’t slip away. All she was made of was tears anymore. <br />
"<br />
"^The hours on the clock ticked away slowly. She stared on into the night. They were awake and moved about her head. Going through her thoughts like tearing through an old file cabinet. Finding the painful ones and reading them aloud to her over and over again. She wondered how much more of this she could stand. Finally she reached her arm over to the bottle that contained about fifteen sleeping pills. With a quick gulp of water she downed the bottle and a smile of accomplishment came over her. She would surly sleep now. Grinning to herself she told them quietly, now you will have to be silent.<br />
"<br />
"©The sun began to rise and paint the sky in color. Leeann had not moved all night. One arm thrown precariously over the side of the bed. Her eyes began to open. She jumped with fright. This can't be true. Her heart raced with excitement. Its him, he's here she screamed. It must be true she thought. How can it not be when he is standing over me? He smiled, she melted. She was so ecstatic she had to tell her parents. <br />
"`Leaping and bounding from her bed she ran as fast as she could to her parents’ room.<br />
"<br />
"¬"Get up, get up now! He is here. He is in my room come and see him for yourself. I'm telling you I didn't kill him," she screeched in their ears. Drowsily her parents got to her feet and followed Leeann to her room. As the walked they noticed the spring in Leeann's step, the way she was acting made them wonder if she could possibly think he was really there. Rolling their eyes they continued to follow her to her room.<br />
"uThe anticipation was mounting for Leeann and she knew the moment she could prove that he was there, was the moment they would know she was not a murder. She loved him so much. The feel of the cold brass of her doorknob in her fingers was invigorating and she felt her moment near. She swung the door open and bounded into the room. She could smell him, hear him, and practically taste him. He was no where in sight. She heard her parents sigh behind her and then whisper to each other. No matter how hard she tried to stop them the tears poured over her cheeks. Then she heard their laughter. The torment it never stopped.<br />
"<br />
"=Looking at one another her parents just sighed. Her mother leaned over and whispered, "Maybe its about time for her to get some help from a professional. On an all the time basis." Her dad sighed. He didn't want her to have to leave, but it was tearing him apart to see her so tormented. He nodded at his wife.<br />
"<br />
"™That day as the clock ticked noon Leeann and her parents pulled up in front of Hollow Hills Institution. Her eyes widened. She heard the fear in their voices for the first time ever. She dragged her feet as she walked up the steps and down the eerie hallway. The walls were closing in on her and she already hated this place. Waiting at the end of the hallway was a woman. She was one of the most beautiful people Leeann had even seen. She was dressed all in white except for her black leggings, which had a run in them all the way up past where the skirt covered. Her blouse was cut a little to low and her black bra showed slightly when she moved. As Leeann approached, the woman she held her hand out and smiled warmly. Leeann attempted to smile, but it came out so half heartedly it ended up being less inviting then the scowl she had on before. The woman just took her hand and led her to a room in the back. <br />
"<br />
""Dr. Franst should be with you soon," before she left Leeann to herself she squeezed her hand softly and her eyes promised it would be ok. So Leeann sat in the dark and waited for a doctor she didn't know, to come and tell her all about the things that were wrong with her. <br />
"<br />
"A dark figure appeared in the doorway and her heart began to race. The voices were begging her to get out of this place. They were scared, and for a moment she felt like she had control of them. He looked at her with the darkest brown eyes she had ever seen. They were blacker than the night sky and not a star to see. She laid back on his bench. They were the most silent she had ever seen them. They weren't yelling at her or telling her to scream. It was almost as though they didn't want to be taken from her, although they seemed to hate her. She thought on this while Dr. Franst moved about the room. He pulled his chair up, got together his clipboard. She felt like she was being observed. She hated it and almost immediately a strong hate for the doctor grew. <br />
"<br />
""So, why is it that you are so sure the boy you killed was in your room the other night," Dr. Franst asked bluntly.<br />
" "I didn't kill him."<br />
"%"Ok, what happened then?"<br />
"k"Plain and simple, he wanted to die, he put that pistol to his head and I cleaned up the mess."<br />
"6"You know that is hard to believe, right?"<br />
"ñ"Yea, but I don't care. I know I didn't do it and that is all that matters. I loved him. I did then. I do now. Nothing will ever change that. He knew that I loved him and so I can live with myself as long as he knows that I love him."<br />
"L“How can you know for sure if he knew or not? Did you tell him?”<br />
"“He knew trust me.”<br />
"I“Leeann, so tell me about this past year since the accident.”<br />
"¯“Well most things considered everyone thought I was doing rather well. I went on like nothing had happened. I smiled, and I pretended to be happy. You know the norm...”<br />
"M“That doesn’t have to be the normal you know,” the doctor cut in.<br />
"9“Well ok it was always normal for me. Anyway, I went on about life. Most people didn’t talk to me much anymore because of what happened. To be honest I didn’t really care to much, at first. It took a very long time for the rumors to get to me just because I had no friends. So when it did, it hit me hard.”<br />
"K“What rumors are you talking about?” Dr. Franst asked politely.<br />
"“The ones saying that I had killed him,” she replied bluntly. “I didn’t know how to deal with it. I started to believe the rumors, I wondered if maybe I had killed him. I got very very lonely and that is when they came to join me. Misery loves company you know?”<br />
"G“Wait a moment,” he said slightly confused, “who are they?”<br />
"“They are the only ones who would talk to me; they kept me company when I just couldn’t stand it anymore. They were so loving and compassionate to me at first. Then their true colors began to show. They didn’t love me; they loved to hear my piercing screams echo in the night.”<br />
"4“So why did you let them stay?” he asked<br />
"Ï“Because they knew I was alive, and they knew I didn’t kill him. They thought it was funny to tell me I did, but they know as well as I do that I would not have killed him,” she replied in a monotone.<br />
"Í“How long does this stupid therapy thing go on for?” She asked glancing at the clock impatiently. Yes, yes we want to go home, they told her. Shut up I don’t care what you want, she snapped at them.<br />
"<br />
"/Dr. Franst wasn’t quite sure what to make of her. He couldn’t tell if she was lying to him or she truly believed the things she was telling him. She had obviously suffered a lot, but what her condition bad enough that she might have killed him. Her parents had brought her to him to get a diagnosis for court. Her trial was in three days. They wanted to plead her insane to get off the charges. She may never get better if she went to jail. He decided he could testify in court for this girl. He wanted to keep seeing her; he wanted her to get better. <br />
"<br />
"‰Leeann look around at the egg shell white walls. They were just as thin. She could hear people screaming everywhere. I don’t belong here. No, no you don’t, we should get out of here. She ignored them. They only want to make you hurt more she told herself, maybe I do belong here. Am I really insane? She laid down and went to sleep. It was easy unlike normal. She began to feel at home.<br />
"<br />
"„There she stood. It was judgment day. She stood in from of a jury of people she didn’t know. They were her either to condemn her or save her. She prayed for a savior. That is all she could ask for. They filed back in from the room when they made their verdict. Everyone looked up. The tension was so thick Leeann couldn’t even breathe. She felt a tear roll down her cheek. How could she win? If she was determined guilty then she would surely be in prison for a long time, and then everyone would be sure of a lie. But in her case was it any better to be innocent and have everyone think she was crazy? What is worse, prison or hospital?<br />
" <br />
"\“Have you reached a verdict?” the judge said slicing right through the silence. <br />
"W“We have your honor. We find the Defendant…” Leeann drew in a sharp breath.<br />
"Ì“Innocent.” The lead juror smiled at Leeann. But Leeann just starred off. Innocent? Innocent, are you kidding me? You did it. They wouldn’t stop. Jumping up in the middle of the room she screamed. <br />
"<br />
"#“Leave me alone! I hate you! I was never lonely enough for you, miserable enough, desperate enough. I didn’t kill him, I have my proof now. I don’t need you anymore.” And with that she walked out of the court room. Down the street and to her house where she sat down and fell asleep. <br />
"éLeeann’s parents were slightly worried; she had been sleeping for about three days and wasn’t eating. They thought about taking her back to Hollow Hills. They knew though she wouldn’t want to go back. They decided to wake her.<br />
"<br />
"_Leeann stirred with the feel of a hand on her arm. She opened her eyes, this time she felt the most relief she had ever felt. When she felt that hand on her arm she didn’t think it was him. She didn’t hear herself screaming that is was. She knew it was her parents and it was comforting. Opening her eyes she looked up at them, smiled and said,<br />
"|“It’s finally really going to be ok. It is really going to be ok this time.” With that she feel back onto the couch. <br />
"<br />
"Õ“They will all know now, the whole world will know that I loved him. That is all that I ever wanted. And they, they are finally quiet. How can the argue with the whole world?” She laid back and slept again.<br />
"ØHer parents just smiled. They knew she was telling the truth. It was so hard for them to believe before. But the way she told them it would be ok. They knew it would. There is almost no wound that time doesn’t heal.

But Im not even going to focus on that because I know and pray we'll get through it. &nbsp;I remember on valentines day. I felt so sad because I didnt think you rememberd. But then you gave me 15 roses. 1 For my age, 3 for our three month anniversury, and 12 well just for shits and giggles. You know I honestly dont think that there is enough room on here to tell you every single thing I love and remember about you. Because each and every day that Im with you adds to the experience. I just cant wait to see you again, give you the same christmas present and make you fall in lvoe all over again. Because each and every day, I think to my self. Why couldnt I have meet you sooner and loved you sooner. I guess we'll never know. I just pray to our lord, that Im the one god intended you to have in your soul.<br />

"
"	LiFE iS N0T REAL.<br />
"<br />
"ìWhat is real? Real is a house, a home, a family, a life. That is YOUR real. That is MY lie. The lie that you tell the little girl so that she will stop <em>crying</em>, the lie you tell her when you say everything is <em>ok</em>. Well its <b>not</b>. It¡¯s <b>NOT OK</b>. It¡¯s a <em>lie</em>. <em>Life</em> is a lie, a harsh lie where you are told that you are ¡°living¡± and if you are lucky, lucky and pure of heart, you will continue to live this lie, this lie of life. But if you sin, you little sinner, you will be told the TRUTH. The truth about real. Real: the demon that chains me to this living hell, Real: the swamp at the end of the road; sticky and black. Real: the dark creature that haunts me in my dreams¡¦the only place I though it was safe, the only place I could hide. Real is when you realize that you are not loved, real is when you realize you <em>have never</em> and <em>will never</em> be loved. Real is when you realize love is a <b>lie</b>; real is when you realize there is <b>no love</b>. Love is what you told the little girl to make her stop crying. You told her you loved her. But you <b>don¡¯t</b>. You don¡¯t love her-->she cries. Crying is a sin. EVERYTHING is a sin. YOU are a sinner, a sinner punishable in hell, the hell that is real. And you wonder¡¦.why do I <em>cry</em>? What have I done so <em>horrible</em>? What was my <em>sin</em>? You were <b>smart</b>. You pondered, you doubted, you explored, you searched for something <u>other than these lies</u>. There was something about them that was <em>not real</em>. And <u>you found it</u>. You found out the <b>secret</b>. They told you there were no secrets. They <b>lied</b>. But if they lie than what Is the truth? The truth is you beat the system, you broke their lie. Everyone was too fucking afraid to do what you have just done. Now mommy <em>hates you</em>. Daddy <em>HATES YOU</em>. They¡¯ve always known, know that you are <b>special</b>, you are <b>different</b>, you are <b>smart</b>. They had hoped that they could <em>keep you quiet</em>. They could <em>hide you forever</em>. &nbsp;They could fill you with lies like their parents had done to them. They could make you like <u>all the other children</u>. They could tell you they loved you. Maybe that will make you stop <em>crying</em>, stop <em>sinning</em>, maybe that will make you fit in. Maybe you wont break free, maybe you wont be smart, maybe if they lie to you they can <b>keep their own lies</b>. Their <em>lying way of life</em>. They <b>fear</b> you. They <b>fear</b> the change. They <b>fear</b> the TRUTH. They always told you the truth was bad. The truth had sin. The truth is for sinners. You are an <em>outcast</em>, so they <em>cast you out</em>. You are too much of a <b>threat</b>. A threat to the life of their lie, their LIE OF LIFE. They <u>must</u> cast you out. They <u>must</u> punish you. You are to face REAL. You are shown the door, you are stripped of your clothes, stripped of your lies- the lies you now wish you could have held onto. <em>Why</em> did you have to be so smart? <em>Why</em> were you so special? <em>Why</em>? <em>WHY?!</em> &nbsp;Now you are cast, thrown, kicked into these firey pits of real. You drown in these fires <em>so cold</em> that you freeze, but you were already frozen, you were always frozen. Frozen and cold. WAIT. This is not freezing you are feeling -it is thawing-, you are felling it for the first time, you are felling EVERYTHING; ANYTHING for the first time. This new warmth overcomes you. Like a wave of <b>life</b>. And you realize that these are not fires, but waves, with every stroke: every motion it brings you a better sense of real, and real life. And the way things really should be. The ice breaks, it melts away, your heart takes it¡¯s first REAL beats, your lungs take their first REAL breaths, you mind has its first REAL thoughts. This real air is dense, it is heavy, but at the same time it puts a slight smile on your face, your <em>first REAL smile</em>. And you KNOW that it is real. Unlike life, real is not a lie, it does not deceive, it does not tell the little girl to shut up, she is not told to stop crying. Real embraces her with open arms. She no longer has to hold it in, no longer lets it collect like ice, no longer it builds up multiplying, enumerating, adding on into thicker sheets and masses of ice and depression to carry on her shoulders. So she embraces the real as it embraces her. She lets it all out. She is so relieved. She hesitates, she should not have told her secrets, she should not have expressed how she really felt. She has sinned. Real shall surely scold her, hit her, cast her out just like the others. She awaits her punishment, she dreads to think what is in store for her, she has done it again! Why must she be like this? But Real does not scold her. Real does not judge her. Real lets her be the real human being that she is to be. So give real a chance. Embrace the life that should be real. A life that ought to be real. But life is still a lie, and no one wants to <em>embrace</em> Real. No one wants to <em>reach</em> for something more. They like their lies. Well you know what? It is too late for them. They are caught up in their <b>own lies</b>. Well fuck them. Mommy <b>lied</b>. Daddy <b>lied</b>. They are <u>part of the lie</u>, <em>embracing the lie</em>, unwilling to <u>reach out for real</u>. <em>Go ahead</em>. I <b>don¡¯t</b> care. Fuck you, you lied. You are a lie, you¡¯ve always been a lie. I just never saw it. You are not real. You are no realer then the lies you told me. Goodbye. I don¡¯t need you. <br />
".Its too late. Too late for all of you. But its not too late for us. We are the generation of hope. No &nbsp;longer will they push us around, no longer will they push us aside, no longer will they tell us the lie, no longer will they deceive us with their words. No longer will they keep us in the dark. Come with me to the light. A place where you can be REAL, experience everything that should be real. Come with me, follow my example, be smart, break the lie, abolish the hate! Crash through the surface! Gasp for air! Come now, Hold my hand. Together we charge the walls of hate- we trample them and leave them in the dust. Maybe if we succeed they will be left as only a lie. Come with me: run, jump, dive into the seemingly flames of real. Dive deep and realize that they are in fact waves, currents of ups and downs, good and bad, hope and wisdom. Embrace the ever beating of your heart, the thumping of your very soul. Lets challenge these lies, take in knowledge, learn, think, lets <em>take on</em> these waters, <em>swim</em> these currents, <em>sail</em> these seas. Together lets take these ¡°lies¡±, these lies of happiness and love, bring them with you to real. Bring them here, <em>hold onto them tight</em>, lets make them <b>real</b>. Realer then they ever were. Lets take these falsities and make them into something <em>better</em>. Lets start a new life. Lets start over. Lets make things <b>right</b>. This starts with <b>you</b> and <b>me</b>. Lets take the ideas I thought were lies, lets take love, laughter and happiness, Lets make them <b>REAL</b>. <br />

Your warm lips caress my neck like the gentle kiss of the ocean breeze. And like a wave of hope washing over me; my heart thumps and beats endlessly for you, and I forget all my problems as I close my eyes and take it all in. And for one mere second, my world is at peace, and everything is okay. But in an instant, just as quickly as it came, my sense of love and security is carried away by the summer winds. And I realize that it is not you that I felt, well maybe it used to be you, but now it is just another playful wisp of memory blowing in the wind and forever taunting with my heart. I open my eyes and I see that I stand alone in this sunset, alone for you are no longer beside me. Now there is only one. One of us; an us that no longer exists. Only one pair of sandy feet, only one softly spoken lullaby to the sea, only one lost lover, and one broken heart. There is only one, one because you are gone.

All I ever wanted is to be with you. But now I'm on the last flight out. ~ Seven years from now I'm in a club play this song with my band. I saw you in the back rocking with you high school friends. I walked up to you,you had a boy friend. I will wait for you under the cork tree where we first meet I told you.~ Why do you do the things you do.All I ever wanted is to be with you. But now I'm on the last flight out.~(10 sec music) Now we're old and grey.<br />
"CSwinging in our rockers.I still play in a band at the retirement center. We are playing at the bingo game tonight. You were losing badly, so I walk over to help. You fall over, it was a heart attack ~ All I ever wanted is to be with you. But now I will stay here under the cork tree where we first meet beside you forever.

"		Rachel why the hell did you do this to me? I was 9 and you were 15. You told me to go to your room and pick out whatever i want'd clothes shoes,cd's. I choose some of clothes, and your monkey,Bob. I still have that monkey. You told me you were taking a shower. 45 mintues later i realized that there had never been any water running. The bathroom door was locked, you never did that, you always left it unlocked so that i could always go in and talk to you if i needed to. That was the second thing that i realized was wrong. I ran back into your room, to your make-up case where you kept your blades when you cut. The way i deal with things now, for the past two years, and i learned it all from you. You used to sew with needle and thread thru your palms. You'd freak out and i would have to get it out for you. Your blades weren't there. i freaked out, i ran to the bathroom and it was still locked. there was no noise when i screamed out your name. It came out whiny and scared, which i hated but i was scared. At your house the linen closet was conntected to the bathroom and you could get into the bathroom thru the linen closet. i got it cabnit openedand crawled thru to the bathroom. You were sprawled out your wrists were slit blood all over the bathtub. Your white cami and white boxer soaked with blood. All i could do was cry and curse myself for beign so stupid and not realizing what you were doing. I started cutting after that. your best friend came by to pick us up to go to the mall, she saw me cradeling your head crying. she called 911. she saved you. I keep my hands on your wrists to try and stop the blood it eventually stopped. You left a two years later. A few months after that you killed yourself. You huant my dreams i always see you covered in blood. tehn i see myself in a mirror. Wearing the outfit you picked out for me with my hair in braids down my back you loved my long hair. After you died i cut it all off. I went numb. then my other best friend deid in a bus wreck i went even number after you died. Then my friend called me and told me that she was going to kill herself. &nbsp;talked her out of it and now im writing this because i cut afterwards and now alot of people are mad at me. But rachel i was mad at you for dying. For teaching me how to cut and how to hide it. how to make the scars not noticable. but i've finally forgiven you after all that you've done...i still love you sis.

Your lifes just so damn hard,But you don't have it as bad as i do. you dont have to deal with getting hit for rolling your eyes, thrown out of your room because you asked why all of your uncles girlfriends kids were in you room. getting choked for not eating, being accused of having an eating disorder 24/7, i cut to deal with pain, you cut for drama. you make everything so god damn dramatic.I try so hard to make you happy, but i'm never good enough for you, i'm just a little rag doll you pick and drop again because it's fun and your bored. You always call me not caring about how many cell minutes im using, and when i call you asking for some quick advice you cant talk. You stole my guy, my best friend i was finally getting the nerve to tell him how i feel and then *boom* you found out and then you had intrest in him. Everything that went wrong with you two was my fault i was flirting to much with him, then one day i got pissed and told you the truth...I was never just his friend but i was never really his girlfriend...with things like that they have to end good or bad, we never ended and you knew that so it's your own fault for getting in the way...i hate you...everything's always about you, your selfish, over-dramatic,rude. <br />

"Ã	He awoke in a cold sweat. Demes and emotions swirling though his head like fire. “Their watching” came a voice from the darkness. He turned in fright eyes wafting from past lack of sleep <br />
"k“ wh-where..” he choaked thought dry and barren.. There was a pause. “Where?” he called into the darkness body shaking with the electric fear. “Their watching...” it called again sound slithering from the very depths of night..“ wh-what do they want?” His sintes tangled with alertness eyes seeing though the dark midnight ink and scooping out the depths of his room. “ where..where are they?” again no answer came but a simple whisper, soft and sinister, “ &nbsp;their watching..” there was a movement in the corner of his eye he turned holding bake a scream as the dart of depth slipped away out of his sight. <br />
"<br />
"Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stayed rooted to his bed in till there was a knock upon his door as it was pushed slowly opened revealing his dishevel mother, robe hastily raped around her well formed body, angry look cluttering her otherwise china doll face. “What is it this time Kiyel ?” she yawned loudly, “ I though boys your age hade grown out of this kind of things…..” she trailed off giving him a look of mirth and bore. He swallowed a hasty get out. He did not want his mother off all people in here right now of all times, not when he was so close to finding out. “Nothing mother. It was just…. A night mare that all.” He lied lamely clinching his bed &nbsp;sheets tightly in his hands. Once again she smirked “ah yes I see. A nightmare right, ok thin good night Kiyel” she turned and shut his door without waiting for a returned ‘goodnight’ or ‘I love you’ He sighed heavily and spared a glance once more around his room. He knew there would be no more sleep tonight. The clock flashed 3:28 in bloody red letters, he yawned lightly and clicked the light on quietly slipping on to muffed carpeted floor, and crossing the room to his closet for close, it was going to be another long day.<br />
"<br />
"– &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Mr.Kiyel” there was an impatient rap on his desk and he jerked violently out of his thoughts.<br />
"ß “Ah Mr.Kiyel so nice of you to join us,” his teacher smirked behind her glasses, murmured giggles slipped thought the class, “ I hope I didn’t disturb any thing important with my teaching did I?” He looked up into her eyes placing a bored look upon his face. “ actually Miss. Donor I was hoping you would halt the lesson for me whale I finish up this thought “ he turned bake to the window and gazed out absently totally ignoring the fact that half the class hade ether gone dead silent or was cracking up at him and the teacher who hade now gone three shades of red and still turning hade ordered silent and stomped bake up to the bored to finish her lecture on Latin America. “She’s a bit to smart for that one” he complained to himself half wishing the stupid one’s where the ones he got instead of his friends. All he needed was the pass room and some quiet. With her rambling on about forgery contrary he couldn’t concentrate. He sighed and shut his book as the last bell rang for dismissal. Another long day of narrowly avoided fights and lies filled. Now it was only the weekend. Another night of no sleep and voices he shivered wishing that voice would show itself he was tired of his mother thinking that he was having wet dreams.<br />
"<br />
" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Kiye..” h felt a shiver cores though him. “Kiyel” the whisper was close. At the end of his bed even. He pried into the darkness at the lone foggy outline of something, not quiet there yet. “I know you can hear me Kiyel, why won’t you answer? I feel lonely now Kiyel. I don’t like being lonely.” The room seemed to chill curtains over the closed window fluttering in the whispered air. “Who…” he gulped “who are you? Why are you here? Wha-“ his voice cracked. “ what do you want?” he felt the room change the curtains where laughing at him for the stupidity. The mirror on the wall was glaring angrily at the young man in bed whose face was pail and streaked with eyeliner and sweat. “No me Kilye.. no no” it laughed sadistically “ it is not me whom you should fear Kilye it is them.” &nbsp;The room was closing in.. The air was thinning; his breath came in ragged gulps as the darkness spun with stares and dazzling allusions of melting solids. “wh-“ he coughed <br />
"y“ who must I fear? Who?” his whispered please were greeted my silences that pressed in on him from all sides.<br />
"N“ answer &nbsp;me!” he shook with silent fear and rage. This thing had been with him for a good few months and it dare fird on his fears and kept him up at nights? No he would not deal with it. “come now .. you have the balls you keep me awake with you insistene whispers . feed upon my disheveled state of mind now answer me!”<br />
"fThe shadow ripped form its previous spot and rushed at his face causing a startled yelp and thump as he fell from his sitting position to the pillow staring the darkness in the fear . His room mocking him , laughing at his fear. “ watch your tongue boy.” It whispered. “ I came for your safety… but if you wish such ill will apon your deliverer…” &nbsp;it paused to let this sink in “ I shall leave you to them. My your body belong gone before the final blow.” &nbsp;With that the darkness shrank bake to normal as the room silenced to its normal self, the gaping window pains with there mocking mouths slipped back into sloth cool glass and the heat kicked on the back gound as he lay there. Panting , trying to get over this new bit of knowledge. “ so it will not bothered me again” he whispered as his shock and faer passed him into a deep and dreamless sleep.<br />
"<br />
"N &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world was hunting him now.<br />
"Mail boxes growled and snapped as he passed. Tree though there branches down upon his fragile head. Radios blaed defining him. Stones and crake found ther wawy into his path tripping him wherever he wint. And with every passing day it only got worse. Loneliness plagued his nights and vision he saw only the black and white as the colors mixed and formed into whirled of hatred and death threats panted themselves out of the food he ate. “are these the ones it was talking about?” he’d question himself daily pushing aside his food for lake of hunger as even his body was against him . Refusing sleep and light. Nightly he was plagued by visions of his own death. The times blurred and school stopped all together. His mother complained her boyfriend agreed like a puppy. It was all sickening to him, and it wouldn’t stop. No voices hade plagued him but every other night the world would gather and point and laugh as he lay petrified of his own shadow which took the shape of its own will and pointed at him &nbsp;mockingly. “is this,” he thought, “ what hell is like? It must be for nothing can be as bad as this.” And again he lived on as the bird glared at him from glassy eyes and midnight taunted him with the twelve tooling bells that ringed of laughter at his plight <br />
"<br />
"Ÿ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice returned after months of tormintion and the world stopped mocking him in its arrival. <br />
"y“ hello again Kiely” &nbsp;it whispered sharp more definition against the darkness. “and how are we tonight?”<br />
"ähe stared determining at the ceiling fan which whispered in its passing blades winging to answer the voice. He focused on disobeying it. “ &nbsp;oh now Kiley don’t be like that..” &nbsp;it purred movingly the room laughed<br />
"£“ you now I’m only her to protect you” &nbsp;Kiyel suddenly say up and winched at the new pains allowed him from the room and shadows nightly beating. “Protect me?” he laugh defiantly, “ from the time you came my world has been nothing but hell. O lost my love. My life.my mom. What is there left to protect me from? , my body itself will soon give out and as you said I shall me away win the final blow’s delt.”<br />
"½Again the room broke out in peals of outrageous laughter even the voice itself chuckled annoyingly apparently he was not the only one being annoyed. “ you are a fool” &nbsp;it purred again voice dripping with acid “ came now to protect you from what’s left of yourself you created me this” it seeped a hand over the room “ every thing enem the injury we have created have been delt by you” &nbsp;he stopped and stared angrily at them all <br />
";“ you mock me no more shadow.” And with that he leaped and aimed a blow unto the shadow that plagued him for so long. “what of this worldly being I have not created such a monsters as yourself you credit me to much “ again he aimed and hit body slipping though the solid mass blood slipping out of his pores.<br />
"¡“ you are mistaken” &nbsp;it hissed and attacked pinning him to the be fole breath he recognized as his own seeped into his nose. “now parish rough one for the blow has been struck” &nbsp;he’s screamed where drown by the pillow that pushed tightly over his face. Suffocating him, the voices rang in his head . taughting laughter, stars appeared in the darkness, the universe was unraveling and the hole stadium was his. He gave up fighting the force and watched in sleepy dreamed as his body stopped its thrashing and twitched involuntary. His heart slowed as his breathing halted. This night became coolers of structured form. And he smiled as it engulfed him hole.<br />

Without saying a word, your arms engulf me and the ashes of your burnt out cigarette float to the floor, resting on my toes as our legs snake around eachother... turn the timer sweetie and keep the sand moving... and I'll give you two minutes of my time. Street lights, cablights, thats what I'l do to you in the morning. Broken glasses, shattered vases, smudged mascara, and in our heated moment, you'll tell me I'm yours and I'll tell you your mine... but we but know thats not true... Pink skies, blue martinis, and red manhattans, lipstick is applied, and phone calls are made... Kiss you on the head sweetie, its time to go.<br />

"u	I used to be so good at speaking. I used to be so good at being able to share my thoughts. But without you, I can't speak anymore. Im searching for some kind of metaphor, some kind of artistically structured prose to explain you, to explain me. But its impossible, and you're impossible. I hate you for what you've done. I hate you for what you've made me become. I feel like I've gone backwards in time, to a time when life didnt make sense 2 me, to a time where an ever changing array of faces kept me from being lonely. But this time, the random faces make me more lonely, because they're not you. I thought i knew you so well, i thought we were the most perfect thing in the world. you helped me through some of the most challenging times in my life. you were ultimately the rock that got me 2 where i am 2day. I owe my success 2 you, because u loved me and made me believe i could do anything, and u gave me a reason 2 try. but you've turned ur back on me, and i feel like i almost couldnt forgive you. but you know id forgive you in a second. i was almost convinced you'd come back 2 me. but all hope of that is gone now. and i hate you for this. i truly hate you for burning our friendship 2 the ground, and it absolutely kills me that u cant face me anymore, and it makes me so angry that i cant just move on. like you have. ive thought about writing u a letter, but i think ive written 2 many of those, im almost afraid ud hate me if i did. ud think im being petty n immature, and disgusted i havent moved on. But i cant help it. because i dont hate you. i dont hate you at all. i love you. i love you so much it hurts, and it hurts that i cant get over you. im trying, i really am. but its not working. i wish i could hold u again, and tell you i love you. and to hear you say it back. Because i love you baby. and i always will. u may think i was a mistake. but my biggest mistake was losing you.

"FLike pieces of a mosaic, there's no place for you anymore,<br />
"*not in my mascara laden heart.<br />
"<You'll no longer belong to my rose tinted world,<br />
"Aonly forced to bear your own dissolusioned happiness.<br />
"EWater engulfing me, the salinity sears back up my throat,<br />
" I can breathe again,<br />
"DAnd the orchestra completes their finale....to silence. <br />
