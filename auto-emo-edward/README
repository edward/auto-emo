===The Point===
Auto-Emo is the answer to the non-creative emo-kid's desires: when your pain and suffering isn't getting you any decent poetry you can share with your similarly miffed scorn-buddies, then run this script and AUTOGENERATE YOUR ANGUISH.

To run the program from a shell:
  ruby auto-emo-edward.rb

Have fun, and remember not to take yourself too seriously!
Thanks to all those emo people out there who make me feel better and to allpoetry.com for collecting their torment!
